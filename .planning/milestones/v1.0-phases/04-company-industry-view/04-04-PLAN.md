  <name>Task 1: Visual verification of Company & Industry View</name>
  <files>src/components/ftc/FTCIndustryTab.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Human visual verification of the complete Phase 4 Company & Industry View.

    What was built:
    - Sector Grid: 8 industry sector cards with case counts, top enforcement topics, expandable subsectors, and compare checkboxes
    - Sector Detail: Breadcrumb navigation, enforcement pattern charts (statutory topics + remedy types as horizontal bars), expandable reference tables, paginated case card list with sort/filter, "View provisions" cross-tab links
    - Sector Comparison: Side-by-side columns (2-3 sectors) showing enforcement pattern charts and top companies for each sector

    Verification steps:

    INDY-01: Browse enforcement actions by industry sector
    1. Navigate to the FTC page and click the "Industries" tab
    2. Verify 8 sector cards are displayed in a responsive grid
    3. Each card shows: sector name, case count badge, 2-3 top enforcement topic tags
    4. Click the expand arrow on a sector card — subsectors with counts should appear
    5. Click the "Technology" sector card — should navigate to the Technology detail view
    6. Verify breadcrumb shows "Industries > Technology" with a back arrow
    7. Click the back arrow — should return to the sector grid

    INDY-02: Enforcement patterns vary across sectors
    8. From the Technology sector detail, scroll to the charts section
    9. Verify two horizontal bar charts: one for statutory topics, one for remedy types
    10. Click a row in the reference table below a chart — it should expand with details
    11. Return to the grid (back arrow)
    12. Check 2 sector checkboxes (e.g., Technology and Healthcare)
    13. A sticky bar should appear with "Compare Selected" button
    14. Click "Compare Selected" — side-by-side columns should appear
    15. Verify each column has its own topic and remedy distribution charts
    16. Verify the charts show visibly different distributions between sectors
    17. Back arrow returns to the grid

    INDY-03: Case cards with company details and provision links
    18. Navigate to any sector detail (e.g., Financial Services)
    19. Scroll to the case cards section
    20. Verify each card shows: company name, year, violation type, provision count
    21. Verify pagination shows max 20 cards per page
    22. Test sort: click a sort option (company name) — cards should reorder
    23. Test filter: select a topic filter — case list should narrow
    24. Click "View provisions" on any case card — should navigate to the Provisions Library tab

    Resume signal: Type "approved" to complete Phase 4, or describe issues to fix.
