FTC Enforcement Provisions Library - Distribution Statistics
Generated: 2026-02-24
Pipeline: classify-offline.ts (enhanced rule-based) -> build-ftc-data.ts -> build-provisions.ts

================================================================================
a. STATUTORY TOPIC DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json, 285 unique cases)
================================================================================
  Topic                         Cases   Notes
  ----------------------------- ------  -----
  Section 5 Only                  179   Most common (generic FTC Act enforcement)
  FCRA                             53   Fair Credit Reporting Act
  COPPA                            37   Children's Online Privacy Protection
  GLBA                             18   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
  TSR                               5   Telemarketing Sales Rule
  Health Breach Notification        2   Health Breach Notification Rule
  CAN-SPAM                          1   CAN-SPAM Act
  TCPA                              0   (No TCPA-specific cases in dataset)

  NOTE: Section 5 Only > 150 cases is expected -- the majority of FTC privacy
  and data security enforcement uses Section 5 alone without a named statute.

================================================================================
b. PRACTICE AREA DISTRIBUTION (from provision shard files)
================================================================================
  Practice Area                                          Provisions   %
  ------------------------------------------------------ ----------  ------
  Privacy                                                    1,540   36.3%
  Data Security                                              1,488   35.1%
  Financial Practices                                          745   17.6%
  Deceptive Design / Dark Patterns                             120    2.8%
  Telemarketing                                                107    2.5%
  AI / Automated Decision-Making                                85    2.0%
  Surveillance                                                  80    1.9%
  Other                                                         72    1.7%
  ------------------------------------------------------ ----------  ------
  Total (provisions may appear in multiple shards)           4,237

  CRITICAL CHECK: No single practice area exceeds 60% threshold.
  Privacy (36.3%) and Data Security (35.1%) are the two largest areas,
  which is expected for FTC enforcement. The "Privacy swallowing everything"
  failure mode documented in research has been avoided.

================================================================================
c. REMEDY TYPE DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json)
================================================================================
  Remedy Type                             Cases
  --------------------------------------- ------
  Other                                     280
  Compliance Monitoring                     276
  Recordkeeping                             270
  Prohibition                               263
  Comprehensive Security Program            154
  Monetary Penalty                          113
  Third-Party Assessment                    100
  Data Deletion                              92
  Biometric Ban                               3
  Algorithmic Destruction                     0

  NOTE: Other/Compliance Monitoring/Recordkeeping/Prohibition are structural
  provisions present in nearly every consent order. Substantive remedy types
  (Comprehensive Security Program, Monetary Penalty, Third-Party Assessment,
  Data Deletion) show meaningful variation across cases.

================================================================================
d. INDUSTRY SECTOR DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json)
================================================================================
  Sector                  Cases
  ----------------------- ------
  Technology                205
  Financial Services        122
  Healthcare                 56
  Retail                     37
  Other                      29
  Social Media               26
  Education                  18
  Telecom                    16

  NOTE: Technology dominates (72% of cases) which is expected for FTC
  privacy/data security enforcement. Many cases involve multiple sectors
  (e.g., a fintech company tagged as both Technology and Financial Services).

  Total shard files: 15
  Largest shards: ~1.6 MB each (section-5-only, pa-privacy, pa-data-security)
  No shard exceeds 2 MB threshold -- no sub-sharding needed for Phase 2.

================================================================================
f. CLASSIFICATION COMPLETENESS
================================================================================
  Source files with statutory_topics:    293 / 293 (100%)
  Cases in ftc-cases.json:              285 (after dedup by docket_number)
  Cases with statutory_topics:          285 / 285 (100%)
  Cases with industry_sectors:          285 / 285 (100%)
  Unique provisions processed:          2,783
  Total provisions across shards:       7,150 (multi-tagged provisions counted per shard)

  Classification method: Enhanced rule-based heuristics (classify-offline.ts)
  using legal_authority, complaint count titles, provision categories/titles,
  business descriptions, and factual background text.

================================================================================
PIPE-06 STATUS
================================================================================
PIPE-06 (ftc-patterns.json): DEFERRED to Phase 5 per CONTEXT.md decision.
No pattern detection runs in Phase 1.

================================================================================
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================
Both old and new fields present on case objects in ftc-cases.json:
  - categories (old): present on all 285 cases
  - statutory_topics (new): present on all 285 cases
  - practice_areas (new): present on all 285 cases
  - industry_sectors (new): present on all 285 cases
  - remedy_types (new): present on all 285 cases
  - provision_counts_by_topic (new): present on all 285 cases

The existing FTC analytics page reads the categories field, which is preserved.
