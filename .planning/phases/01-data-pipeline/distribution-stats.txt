Pipeline: Claude Code agents (Opus 4.6 reasoning) -> merge-classifications.ts -> build-ftc-data.ts -> build-provisions.ts

================================================================================
a. STATUTORY TOPIC DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json, 285 unique cases)
================================================================================
  Topic                         Cases   Notes
  ----------------------------- ------  -----
  Section 5 Only                  177   Most common (generic FTC Act enforcement)
  FCRA                             46   Fair Credit Reporting Act
  COPPA                            36   Children's Online Privacy Protection
  GLBA                             24   Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act
  Health Breach Notification        6   Health Breach Notification Rule
  TSR                               5   Telemarketing Sales Rule
  CAN-SPAM                          1   CAN-SPAM Act
  TCPA                              0   (No TCPA-specific cases in dataset)

  NOTE: Section 5 Only is expected to dominate — the majority of FTC privacy
  and data security enforcement uses Section 5 alone without a named statute.

================================================================================
b. PRACTICE AREA DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json, case-level)
================================================================================
  Practice Area                                  Cases   % of cases
  ---------------------------------------------- ------  ----------
  Privacy                                          152     53.3%
  Data Security                                     88     30.9%
  Financial Practices                               54     18.9%
  Surveillance                                      28      9.8%
  Deceptive Design / Dark Patterns                  12      4.2%
  Other                                              9      3.2%
  AI / Automated Decision-Making                     5      1.8%
  Telemarketing                                      4      1.4%

  NOTE: Cases can have multiple practice areas. No single area is >60%.

  PROVISION-LEVEL DISTRIBUTION (from shard files):
  Practice Area                                Provisions    % of unique
  ---------------------------------------------- ----------  ----------
  pa-privacy                                      1,379       49.5%
  pa-data-security                                  804       28.9%
  pa-financial-practices                            403       14.5%
  pa-surveillance                                   104        3.7%
  pa-other                                           87        3.1%
  pa-deceptive-design-dark-patterns                  59        2.1%
  pa-ai-automated-decision-making                    39        1.4%
  pa-telemarketing                                   34        1.2%

  Privacy at 49.5% of provisions — under 60% threshold but higher than the
  rule-based 36.3%. The LLM classification is more aggressive in tagging
  provisions that mention privacy-adjacent concepts. Monitor in Phase 2 UI.

================================================================================
c. REMEDY TYPE DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json)
================================================================================
  Remedy Type                             Cases
  --------------------------------------- ------
  Other                                     282
  Compliance Monitoring                     274
  Recordkeeping                             270
  Prohibition                               267
  Monetary Penalty                          111
  Third-Party Assessment                     99
  Comprehensive Security Program             95
  Data Deletion                              80
  Algorithmic Destruction                     3
  Biometric Ban                               2

  NOTE: Other/Compliance Monitoring/Recordkeeping/Prohibition are structural
  provisions present in nearly every consent order. Substantive remedy types
  show meaningful variation.

================================================================================
d. INDUSTRY SECTOR DISTRIBUTION (from ftc-cases.json)
================================================================================
  Sector                  Cases
  ----------------------- ------
  Technology                146
  Financial Services         59
  Retail                     44
  Healthcare                 30
  Other                      23
  Social Media               16
  Education                   8
  Telecom                     7

  NOTE: Technology is the largest sector at 51% of cases. Less over-assigned
  than the rule-based approach (which had 72% Technology) — the LLM better
  distinguishes companies that use technology from tech companies.

e. SHARD FILE SIZES
================================================================================
  File                                                        Size (KB)

  Total shard files: 15
  Largest shards: ~1.5 MB each (section-5-only, pa-privacy)
  No shard exceeds 2 MB threshold — no sub-sharding needed for Phase 2.

================================================================================
f. CLASSIFICATION COMPLETENESS
================================================================================
  Source files with statutory_topics:    293 / 293 (100%)
  Cases in ftc-cases.json:              285 (after dedup by docket_number)
  Cases with statutory_topics:          285 / 285 (100%)
  Cases with industry_sectors:          285 / 285 (100%)
  Unique provisions processed:          2,783
  Total provisions across shards:       5,782 (multi-tagged provisions counted per shard)

  Classification method: Claude Code agents (Opus 4.6) classifying in 6
  parallel batches. Each agent read extracted case fields (company info,
  legal_authority, business_description, complaint counts, factual background,
  provision details) and applied reasoning-based classification.

================================================================================
g. COMPARISON: LLM vs RULE-BASED CLASSIFICATION
================================================================================
  Metric                          LLM (Opus)    Rule-based    Notes
  ------------------------------- ----------    ----------    -----
  Section 5 Only cases            177           179           ~same
  FCRA cases                      46            53            LLM less aggressive
  COPPA cases                     36            37            ~same
  GLBA cases                      24            18            LLM found 6 more
  Health Breach Notification      6             2             LLM found 4 more
  Technology sector               146 (51%)     205 (72%)     LLM less over-assigned
  Financial Services sector       59 (21%)      122 (43%)     LLM less over-assigned
  Surveillance practice area      28 cases      ~5 cases      LLM much better detection
  Privacy provision %             49.5%         36.3%         LLM slightly higher
  Algorithmic Destruction         3             0             LLM found 3 cases
  Biometric Ban                   2             3             Similar

  Key differences: LLM classification shows better nuance in industry sector
  assignment (fewer false positives from keyword matching), better detection of
  niche categories (Health Breach Notification, Surveillance, Algorithmic
  Destruction), and less over-assignment of broad categories (Technology,
  Financial Services).

================================================================================
PIPE-06 STATUS
================================================================================
PIPE-06 (ftc-patterns.json): DEFERRED to Phase 5 per CONTEXT.md decision.
No pattern detection runs in Phase 1.

================================================================================
BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY
================================================================================
Both old and new fields present on case objects in ftc-cases.json:
  - categories (old): present on all 285 cases
  - statutory_topics (new): present on all 285 cases
  - practice_areas (new): present on all 285 cases
  - industry_sectors (new): present on all 285 cases
  - remedy_types (new): present on all 285 cases
  - provision_counts_by_topic (new): present on all 285 cases

The existing FTC analytics page reads the categories field, which is preserved.
