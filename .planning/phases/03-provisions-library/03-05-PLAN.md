  <files>src/components/ftc/FTCProvisionsTab.tsx</files>
  <action>
    Human visual verification of the complete Phase 3 provisions library.

    What was built:
    - Topic sidebar with 25 topics grouped by Statutory Authority, Practice Area, and Remedy Type
    - Provision cards with verbatim order language, context headers, and FTC.gov links
    - Filter bar with date range presets, company autocomplete, remedy type multi-select, and sort controls
    - Full-text search via MiniSearch with scope toggle (This topic / All topics)
    - Cross-topic search results grouped by topic with highlight
    - Pagination for large result sets

    Verification steps:
    1. Open http://localhost:8080/FTCAnalytics?tab=provisions
    2. Verify landing view shows total provision/case counts and topic sidebar with badges
    3. Click "COPPA" — verify provision cards with context header (company, year, docket, citation, violation type) and verbatim order text
    4. Verify "View on FTC.gov" link opens in new tab, single disclaimer banner at top
    5. Click "Obama era" date preset — verify provisions filter to 2009-2017
    6. Use company autocomplete — verify filter works
    7. Select a remedy type — verify filter works
    8. Verify filter chips appear and are dismissible, "Clear all" works
    9. Click sort by Company — verify alphabetical reorder
    10. Type "security program" in search — verify highlighted matches
    11. Toggle to "All topics" — verify cross-topic results grouped by topic
    12. Select "Section 5 Only" — verify no performance lag with ~1,583 provisions
    13. Verify law-library aesthetic (EB Garamond, cream/gold/dark-green, sharp corners)
