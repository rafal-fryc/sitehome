If the Assessor had access to a document by an electronic means controlled by Respondents, such as a fileshare or repository, to which the Assessor no longer has access, the Assessor must identify the document for production by Respondents as it existed at the time the Assessor had access to it. No document may be withheld from the Commission by the Assessor, or by any Respondent if previously provided to the Assessor, on the basis of a claim of confidentiality, proprietary or trade secrets, work product protection, attorney-client privilege, statutory protection, or any similar claim.\n\nB.

Each Assessment must, for the entire assessment period: (1) determine whether Respondents have implemented and maintained the Information Security Program required by Provision II of this Order, titled Mandated Information Security Program; (2) assess the effectiveness of Respondents’ implementation and maintenance of sub- Provisions II.A-L; (3) identify any gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material noncompliance with, the Information Security Program; (4) address the status of gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material non-compliance with, the Information Security Program that were identified in any prior Assessment required by this Order; and (5) identify specific evidence (including documents reviewed, sampling and testing performed, and interviews conducted) examined to make such determinations, assessments, and identifications, and explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an enterprise of Respondent’s size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify the Assessor’s findings. No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management. The Assessment must be signed by the Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team worked on the Assessment. To the extent that Respondents revise, update, or add one or more safeguards required under Provision II of this Order during an Assessment period, the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.\n\nE. Each Assessment must be completed within 90 days after the end of the reporting period to which the Assessment applies. Unless otherwise directed by a Commission representative in writing, Respondents must submit the initial Assessment to the Commission within 10 days after the Assessment has been completed via email to DEbrief@ftc.gov or by overnight courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Provided, however: 1. A Practice by Hotels and Resorts shall not be deemed in compliance with Part I of this Order based upon a Part ll.A Assessment ifH otels and Resorts made a representation, express or implied, regarding the Practice that either misrepresented or omitted a material fact and such misrepresentation or omission would likely affect a reasonable Assessor's decision about whether the Practice complied with the Approved Standard.

Hotels and Resorts shall not be deemed in compliance with Part I of this Order based upon a Part ll.A Assessment as to any Practice that is a significant change from any Practice in place at the time of the Assessment in question, unless, at the time of the significant change, an assessor qualified under Part ll.A.3 certifies that the significant change does not cause Hotels and Resorts to fall out of compliance with the Approved Standard on which the Assessment in question was based.\n\nand Resorts shall provide each Assessment required by this Part II, including any Part II.B certification or Part II.C report, to the Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer 9 Case 2:13-cv-01887-ES-JAD Document 283 Filed 12/11115 Page 10 of 18 PageiD: 5029 Protection, Federal Trade Commission, within ten (10) days after the Assessment, certification, or report is delivered to Hotels and Resorts by the assessor or investigator in question.
