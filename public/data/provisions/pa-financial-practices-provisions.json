Defendants are ordered to pay to the FTC SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED SIXTY THREE DOLLARS ($64,863), which, as Defendants stipulate, their undersigned counsel holds in escrow for no purpose other than payment to the FTC. Such payment must be made within 7 days of entry of this Order by electronic fund transfer in accordance with instructions previously provided by a representative of the FTC. Ninety-one days after the completion of such payment, the remainder of the judgment is suspended, subject to the Subsections below.\n\nC. The FTC’s agreement to the suspension of part of the judgment is expressly premised upon the truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness of Defendants’ sworn financial statement and related documents (collectively, “financial representations”) submitted to the FTC, namely: (1) the Financial Statement of Corporate Defendant BMS, Inc. signed Page 8 of 17 Case 1:20-cv-00641-STV Document 6 Filed 03/09/20 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 54 by William Airy, CEO on November 15, 2019, including the attachments; and (2) the Financial Statement of Individual Defendant William Airy signed on November 15, 2019, including the attachments. D. The suspension of the judgment will be lifted as to any Defendant if, upon motion by the FTC, the Court finds that Defendant failed to disclose any material asset, materially misstated the value of any asset, or made any other material misstatement or omission in the financial representations identified above.\n\nF. Defendants relinquish dominion and all legal and equitable right, title, and interest in all assets transferred pursuant to this Order and may not seek the return of any assets.\n\nG. The facts alleged in the Complaint will be taken as true, without further proof, in any subsequent civil litigation by or on behalf of the FTC, including in a proceeding to enforce its rights to any payment or monetary judgment pursuant to this Section, such as a nondischargeability complaint in any bankruptcy case. H. The facts alleged in the Complaint establish all elements necessary to sustain an action by the FTC pursuant to Section 523(a)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(2)(A), and this Order will have collateral estoppel effect for such purposes.\n\nI. Defendants acknowledge that their Taxpayer Identification Numbers (Social Security Numbers or Employer Identification Numbers) may be used for collecting and reporting on any delinquent amount arising out of this Order, in accordance with 31 U.S.C. §7701.\n\nJ. All money paid to the FTC pursuant to this Section may be deposited into a fund administered by the FTC or its designee to be used for equitable relief, including consumer redress and any attendant expenses for the administration of any redress fund. If a representative of the FTC decides that direct redress to consumers is wholly or partially impracticable or money remains after redress is completed, the FTC may apply any remaining money for such other equitable relief (including consumer information remedies) as it determines to be reasonably related to Defendants’ practices alleged in the Complaint. Any money not used for such equitable relief is to be deposited to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement. Defendants have no right to challenge any actions the FTC or its representatives may take pursuant to this Subsection.",

Technical safeguards such as modifying Defendant’s sales technologies (including but not limited to Street Genie) designed to prevent sales employees and agents from improperly obtaining Consumer Reports from CRAs; 3. An internal “ethics hotline” or similar mechanism to which sales employees and agents must report any sales integrity issues, including potential violations of the FCRA, along with a system for receiving, retaining, and addressing such employee allegations; 4. Escalating sales employee and agent disciplinary measures for FCRA violations and failure to report FCRA violations, up to and including termination; and 5. Review and modification, at least once every 12 months, of Defendant’s sales goals, performance management and sales employee and agent compensation to ensure all are consistent with the objective of preventing FCRA violations; and\n\nF.
