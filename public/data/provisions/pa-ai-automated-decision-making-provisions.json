Respondents must implement modifications to substantially and timely remediate any identified risks that consumers may experience physical, financial, or reputational injury, stigma, or severe emotional 12 Case 2:23-cv-05023-KBH Document 19 Filed 02/26/24 Page 20 of 138 distress, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect particular demographics of consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability (alone or in combination);\n\nF. Provide the written System Assessment and Program, and any evaluations thereof or updates thereto, to Respondents’ board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of Respondents responsible for the Program at least once every twelve (12) months; and\n\nG. Not deploy or discontinue deployment of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System if: 1. Respondents do not possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that is sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards generally accepted in the relevant scientific fields, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that Outputs of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System are likely to be accurate. For purposes of this Provision III, competent and reliable scientific evidence means tests, analyses, research, or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results; or 2. Respondents have reason to believe, taking into account the System Assessment, the Program, all consumer complaints, and all monitoring, testing, documentation, and evaluations conducted pursuant to the Program, that: a. Respondents’ use of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System creates or contributes to a risk that Inaccurate Outputs will cause consumers to experience substantial physical, financial, or reputational injury, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability, stigma, or severe emotional distress to consumers, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability; and b. The identified risks are not substantially and timely eliminated by modifications to the Program.",

Respondents shall provide such notice prior to taking, or, if prior notice is infeasible, at the time of taking an action, and the notice shall include: 1. The date, approximate time, and location of the Output; 2. A description of the action or actions taken; 3. An explanation of how that action relates to the Output; and 4. An email address, online form, mailing address, and telephone number to which consumers can direct complaints or inquiries about the Output; the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System that generated the Output; or the use, sharing, or retention of their Biometric Information.\n\nC. Investigate each complaint to (1) determine whether the relevant Output was an Inaccurate Output, and, if so, identify any factors that likely contributed to the generation of an Inaccurate Output; and (2) assess whether Operators responded to the Output in a manner that was appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this Order; and\n\n1. Within seven (7) days of receiving the complaint, providing written confirmation of receipt to the consumer who submitted the complaint. Such written confirmation should be provided using the same means of communication that the consumer used to submit the complaint, or by another means selected by the consumer during the complaint submission process, and should state that Respondents will investigate the consumer’s complaint and provide its conclusions within thirty (30) days;\n\n2.
