Each safeguard must be based on the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in the unauthorized access, collection, use, Deletion, disclosure of, or provision of access to, the Covered Information. Such safeguards must also include: 1. policies, procedures, and technical measures to systematically inventory Covered Information in the Covered Business’s control and Delete Covered Information that is no longer reasonably necessary and in accordance with applicable retention laws and regulations; 2. policies, procedures, and technical measures to prevent the collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information inconsistent with the Covered Business’s representations to consumers; 3. audits, assessments, and reviews of the contracts, privacy policies, and terms of service associated with any Third Party to which the Covered Business discloses, or provides access to, Covered Information; 4. policies and technical measures that limit employee and contractor access to Covered Information to only those employees and contractors with a legitimate business need to access such Covered Information; 5. mandatory privacy training programs for all employees on at least an annual basis, updated to address the collection, use, and disclosure of Covered Information for advertising purposes; any internal or external risks identified by Respondent in sub- Provision VI.D; and safeguards implemented pursuant to sub-Provision VI.E, that include training on the requirements of this Order; 6. a data retention policy that, at a minimum, includes: a. a retention schedule that limits the retention of Covered Information for only as long as is necessary to fulfill the purpose for which the Covered Information was collected; provided, however, that such Covered Information need not be Deleted, and may be disclosed, to the extent requested by a government agency or required by law, regulation, or court order; and b. a requirement that Respondent documents, adheres to, and makes publicly available on its terms of service/use a retention schedule for Covered Information, setting forth: (1) the purposes for which the Covered Information is collected; (2) the specific business need for retaining each type of Covered Information; and (3) a set timeframe in accordance with applicable laws and regulations for Deletion of each type of Covered Information (absent any intervening Deletion requests from consumers) that precludes indefinite retention of any Covered Information; 10 7. for each product or service, policies and procedures to document internally the decision to collect, use, Delete, disclose, or provide access to, each type of Covered Information. Such documentation should include: (a) the name(s) of the person(s) who made the decision; (b) for what purpose the type of Covered Information is being collected; (c) the data segmentation controls in place to ensure that the Covered Information collected is only used and/or disclosed for the particular purpose(s) for which it was collected; (d) the data retention limit set and the technical means for achieving Deletion; (e) the safeguards in place to prevent unauthorized disclosure of each type of Covered Information; and (f) the access controls in place to ensure only authorized employees with a need-to-know have access to the Covered Information; 8. audits, assessments, reviews, or testing of each mechanism by which the Covered Business discloses Covered Information to a Third Party or provides a Third Party with access to Covered Information (including but not limited to web beacons, pixels, and Software Development Kits); and 9. for each product or service offered by any Covered Business, Clearly and Conspicuously disclose the categories of Covered Information collected from consumers, the purposes for the collection of each category of Covered Information, and any transfer of Covered Information to a Third Party.
