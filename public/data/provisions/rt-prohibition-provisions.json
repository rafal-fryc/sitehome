Gathering any information or data from any computer via any geophysical location tracking technology without ensuring that the computer user is provided clear and prominent notice at the time the computer is rented and immediately prior to each use of the geophysical location tracking technology, and also ensuring that the computer renter’s affirmative express consent is obtained at the time the computer is rented. For purposes of this section, providing clear and prominent notice to computer users and obtaining affirmative express consent from computer renters means:\n\n1. Clear and Prominent Notice: a clear and prominent notice is provided to the user, separate and apart from any “privacy policy,” “data use policy,” “terms of service,” “end-user license agreement,” “lease agreement,” or other similar document, that discloses (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and/or currently running on the computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\n2. Affirmative Express Consent: affirmative express consent is obtained by giving the computer renter an equally clear and prominent choice to either agree or not agree to any geophysical location tracking technology, and neither option may be highlighted or preselected as a default setting. Activation of any geophysical location tracking technology must not proceed until the computer’s renter provides affirmative express consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Part shall require that a computer be rented to a user who declines to consent to installation or activation of any geophysical tracking technology;\n\n3. Icons: the activation of any geophysical location tracking technology shall be accompanied by the installation of a clear and prominent icon on the computer on which the technology is installed, such as on the desktop and in the desktop system tray of the computer. Clicking on the icon must clearly and prominently disclose: (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and currently running on the Page 4 of 8 computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\nProvided that the notice requirements of this Part may be suspended and geophysical location tracking technology activated if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen, and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen. Provided further that respondent shall ensure that documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained. For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the reporting of a complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction;\n\nProvided further that the notice and record-keeping requirements of this Section II shall be satisfied when respondent acts as a licensor if respondent includes in the licensing agreement contractual requirements that: (i) licensees may only activate geophysical location tracking technology if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen, and (ii) documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained by the licensees; and\n\nB. Licensing, selling, or otherwise providing any third party with geophysical location tracking technology for installation or activation on a computer to be rented in a covered rent-to-own transaction, without requiring as a condition of the license, sale, or other provision of the technology that the third party obtain consent and provide notice as provided in Section II.A, above.",

Provided further that respondent shall retain documents establishing (a) and (b). For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the filing of the renter’s or respondent’s complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction.",
