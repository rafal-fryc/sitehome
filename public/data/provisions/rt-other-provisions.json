When a payday loan or certain other unsecured credit has been taken or opened using the Affected Consumer’s Social Security number; 16 d. When banking activity is detected related to new deposit account applications, opening of new deposit accounts, changes to an Affected Consumer’s personal information on an account, and new signers being added to an Affected Consumer’s account; and e. When a balance is reported on an Affected Consumer’s credit line that has been inactive for at least six months; 4. One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) in identity theft insurance to cover costs related to incidents of identity theft or identity fraud, with coverage prior to the Affected Consumer’s enrollment in the Product, provided the costs result from a stolen identity event first discovered during the policy period and subject to the terms of the insurance policy; 5. A customer service center to provide assistance with enrollment, website navigation, monitoring alerts questions, dispute assistance, fraud resolution assistance, and other assistance related to the Product; 6. For Affected Consumers under the age of 18, the Product includes child monitoring services where the parent or guardian can enroll the Affected Consumer under the age of 18 to receive the following services: alerts when data elements submitted for monitoring appear on suspicious websites, such as websites on the “dark web;” and alerts when the Social Security number of an Affected Consumer under the age of 18 is associated with new names or addresses or the creation of a Consumer Report at one or more of the three Nationwide Consumer Reporting Agencies.\n\nH.
