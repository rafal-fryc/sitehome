In the event such default continues for 10 days beyond the date that payment is due, the entire amount will immediately become due and payable.\n\nF. Each day of nonpayment is a violation through continuing failure to obey or neglect to obey a final order of the Commission and thus will be deemed a separate offense and violation for which a civil penalty shall accrue.\n\nG.
