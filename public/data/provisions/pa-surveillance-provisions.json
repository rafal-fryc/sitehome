For purposes of this section, providing clear and prominent notice to computer users and obtaining affirmative express consent from computer renters means:\n\n1. Clear and Prominent Notice: a clear and prominent notice is provided to the user, separate and apart from any “privacy policy,” “data use policy,” “terms of service,” “end-user license agreement,” “lease agreement,” or other similar document, that discloses (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and/or currently running on the computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\n2. Affirmative Express Consent: affirmative express consent is obtained by giving the computer renter an equally clear and prominent choice to either agree or not agree to any geophysical location tracking technology, and neither option may be highlighted or preselected as a default setting. Activation of any geophysical location tracking technology must not proceed until the computer’s renter provides affirmative express consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Part shall require that a computer be rented to a user who declines to consent to installation or activation of any geophysical tracking technology;\n\n3. Icons: the activation of any geophysical location tracking technology shall be accompanied by the installation of a clear and prominent icon on the computer on which the technology is installed, such as on the desktop and in the desktop system tray of the computer. Clicking on the icon must clearly and prominently disclose: (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and currently running on the Page 4 of 8 computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\nProvided that the notice requirements of this Part may be suspended and geophysical location tracking technology activated if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen, and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen. Provided further that respondent shall ensure that documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained. For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the reporting of a complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction;\n\nProvided further that the notice and record-keeping requirements of this Section II shall be satisfied when respondent acts as a licensor if respondent includes in the licensing agreement contractual requirements that: (i) licensees may only activate geophysical location tracking technology if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen, and (ii) documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained by the licensees; and\n\nB. Licensing, selling, or otherwise providing any third party with geophysical location tracking technology for installation or activation on a computer to be rented in a covered rent-to-own transaction, without requiring as a condition of the license, sale, or other provision of the technology that the third party obtain consent and provide notice as provided in Section II.A, above.",

Periodically, and at least annually, reviewing the means by which Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is captured, including the extent to which any software or hardware used to collect Biometric Information is functioning properly and are consistently capturing samples of Biometric Information that meet the quality standards developed and implemented pursuant to sub-Provision III.D.6.a and are not otherwise contributing to the generation of Inaccurate Outputs; and 7. Conducting documented testing of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System prior to deployment and at least once every twelve (12) months thereafter. Such testing must be conducted with the Affirmative Express Consent of individuals whose Biometric Information will be used for testing and must: a. Be conducted under conditions that materially replicate the conditions under which the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is actually used, taking into account factors that affect the accuracy of the type of Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System to be tested, the means by which Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is captured, and the roles of Operators; b. Determine the rate at which the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System’s Outputs are Inaccurate, including by assessing the extent to which the Outputs can be verified using evidence or information other than an Output of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System. For example, if an Output indicates the identity of an individual, the Output is verified if it is corroborated by a review of government- issued identification documents; c. Identify factors that cause or contribute to Inaccurate Outputs; and d. Assess and measure any statistically significant variation in the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System’s rate of Inaccurate Outputs depending on demographic characteristics of the consumers whose Biometric Information is analyzed or used, such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, or disability (alone or in combination).\n\nE. Evaluate and adjust the Program in light of any circumstance that Respondents know or have reason to know may materially affect the Program’s effectiveness. At a minimum, every twelve (12) months, each Covered Business must evaluate the effectiveness of the Program in light of the System Assessment and the results of all monitoring, testing, and 12 documentation conducted pursuant to the Program. Respondents must implement modifications to substantially and timely remediate any identified risks that consumers may experience physical, financial, or reputational injury, stigma, or severe emotional distress, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect particular demographics of consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability (alone or in combination);\n\nF. Provide the written System Assessment and Program, and any evaluations thereof or updates thereto, to Respondents’ board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of Respondents responsible for the Program at least once every twelve (12) months; and\n\nG. Not deploy or discontinue deployment of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System if: 1. Respondents do not possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that is sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards generally accepted in the relevant scientific fields, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that Outputs of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System are likely to be accurate. For purposes of this Provision III, competent and reliable scientific evidence means tests, analyses, research, or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results; or 2. Respondents have reason to believe, taking into account the System Assessment, the Program, all consumer complaints, and all monitoring, testing, documentation, and evaluations conducted pursuant to the Program, that: a. Respondents’ use of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System creates or contributes to a risk that Inaccurate Outputs will cause consumers to experience substantial physical, financial, or reputational injury, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability, stigma, or severe emotional distress to consumers, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability; and b. The identified risks are not substantially and timely eliminated by modifications to the Program.",
