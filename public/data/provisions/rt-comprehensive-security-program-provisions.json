Within 180 days of the issuance date of this order, implement, maintain, and document the following security measures: 1. Disconnect from the Hosting Service environment all hardware assets with Respondent-managed software installed that is no longer supported by a vendor, a Respondent, or other party through the provision of software updates or patches to address vulnerabilities, such as software that is considered end-of-life, or, if disconnection is infeasible, temporarily implement appropriate controls to mitigate threats and document a plan to disconnect the asset or software that includes an appropriate timeline;\n\n2. Use technical measures to detect and prevent anomalous changes to Respondent- managed critical operating system and application files by comparing such files to known baselines, such as file hash values, or, where such baselines are not available, by relying on methods such as non-signature-based technologies, including techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. In the alternative, Respondents may use immutable deployments to prevent unauthorized modifications of any system and application files managed by Respondents that are not monitored using such technical measures;\n\n3. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method for all employees of Respondents and staff of contractors and third-party affiliates in order to access and maintain access (such as through a single sign-on authentication method) to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database. Each such multi-factor authentication method shall not include telephone call or SMS- based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the multi-factor authentication options required by the preceding sentences, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub-Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\n4. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method, or widely-adopted industry authentication option that provides at least equivalent security, be provided as an option for customers to authenticate into any Respondent-developed Hosting Service administration tool or database, excluding any SSH or machine-to-machine-only interface, such as an application programming interface (“API”), that does not support multi-factor authentication, including offering customers at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security keys. Any information collected by Respondents from customers for the purpose of enabling multi-factor authentication may only be used for authentication purposes and no other purpose; and\n\n5. Protect any API developed by Respondents that provides access to any Hosting Service configuration or administration or Covered Information by, at a minimum: a. Using technical controls to require connections to the API to use HTTPS or an equivalently secure transfer protocol for all requests; b. Requiring that all requests to any such API that provides access to Covered Information, including any Hosting Service administration tool that can access Covered Information, be authenticated using a method that protects authenticity at the session level and includes appropriate protections against session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions; c. Using appropriate rate-limiting for connections to the API; and d. Monitoring inbound and outbound API communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks;\n\nH. Assess, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards and security measures in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and Covered Information, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results;\n\nI. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards and security measures at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability scanning of Respondents’ network(s) at least once daily, penetration testing of Respondents’ network(s) at least once every 12 months, and, in the event of a Covered Incident, a security assessment or penetration testing of affected systems promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following the Covered Incident;\n\nJ. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Hosting Services and Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondents, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and such Covered Information;\n\nK. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program as needed in light of any changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision II.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards or security measures. At a minimum, Respondents must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results; and\n\nL. Either during the due diligence process of the acquisition of any entity (“Acquired Entity”) that would become part of any Hosting Service or following such acquisition, Respondents must assess the Acquired Entity’s safeguards and independently test the effectiveness of the safeguards to protect from unauthorized access any Hosting Service of which the Acquired Entity would become a part. Respondents shall not integrate any of the Acquired Entity’s application or information systems into any Respondent’s network until (1) all material risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any Hosting Service identified in such a test are remediated; and (2) such application or information system meets the requirements of this Provision. Provided, however, that Respondents shall have 90 days after integrating any application or information system of an Acquired Entity into its networks to implement the requirements of sub-Provision II.G.4 with respect to such application or system.",
