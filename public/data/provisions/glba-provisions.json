Maintain all documentation provided by each Vendor pursuant to sub-Provision II.E.1 for a period of five (5) years from when it was provided; and\n\n3. At least once every twelve (12) months, and promptly following a Covered Incident involving a Vendor, conduct written assessments of each Vendor to determine the continued adequacy of their safeguards to control the internal and external risks to the security of Covered Information. The level of the assessment for each Vendor should be commensurate with the risk it poses to the security of Covered Information.\n\n4.
