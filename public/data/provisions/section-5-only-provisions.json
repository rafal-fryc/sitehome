To satisfy this requirement, Respondent must, at a minimum:\n\nA. Document in writing the content, implementation, and maintenance of the Information Security Program;\n\nB. Provide the written program and any evaluations thereof or material updates thereto to Respondent’s board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of Respondent responsible for Respondent’s Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nC. Designate a qualified employee to coordinate and be responsible for the Information Security Program;\n\nD. Assess and document, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) following a Covered Incident, internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information that could result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (2) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information;\n\nE. Design, implement, maintain, and document safeguards that control for the internal and external risks Respondent identifies to the security, confidentiality, availability, or integrity of Covered Information identified in response to sub-Provision V.D. Each safeguard must take into account the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, alteration, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (2) misuse, loss, theft, destruction, or other compromise of such information. Such safeguards must also include: 1. Training of all of Respondent’s employees, at least once every 12 months, on how to safeguard Covered Information; 2. Documenting in writing the content, implementation, and maintenance of an incident response plan designed to ensure the identification of, investigation of, and response to the unauthorized access to Covered Information. Respondent shall revise and update this incident response plan to adapt to any changes to its assets or networks; 3. Implementing technical measures to log and monitor Respondent’s networks and assets for anomalous activity and active threats. Such measures shall require Respondent to determine baseline system activity and identify and respond to anomalous events and unauthorized attempts to access or exfiltrate Covered Information; 4. Policies and procedures to minimize data collection, storage, and retention, including data deletion or retention policies and procedures; 5. Implementing data access controls for all assets (including databases) storing Covered Information and technical measures, policies, and procedures to minimize or prevent online attacks resulting from the misuse of valid credentials, including: (a) restricting inbound and outbound connections; (b) requiring and enforcing strong passwords or other credentials; (c) preventing the reuse of known compromised credentials to access Covered Information; (d) implementing automatic password resets for known compromised credentials; and (e) limiting employee access to what is needed to perform that employee’s job function; 6. Requiring multi-factor authentication methods for all employees, contractors, and affiliates in order to access any assets (including databases) storing Covered Information. Such multi-factor authentication methods for all employees, contractors, and affiliates should not include telephone or SMS-based 6 authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks. Respondent may use equivalent, widely adopted industry authentication options that are not multi-factor, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub-Provision V.C: (1) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (2) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication; 7. Developing and implementing configuration standards to harden system components against known threats and vulnerabilities. New system components shall not be granted access to Respondent’s network, resources, or Covered Information until they meet Respondent’s configuration standards; 8. Encryption of, at a minimum, all Social Security numbers, passport numbers, financial account information, tax information, dates of birth associated with a user’s account, Medical Information associated with a user’s account, and user account credentials on Respondent’s computer networks, including but not limited to cloud storage; 9. Policies and procedures to ensure that all information technology (“IT”) assets on Respondent’s network with access to Covered Information are securely installed and inventoried at least once every 12 months; 10. Implementing vulnerability and patch management measures, policies, and procedures that require confirmation that any directives to apply patches or remediate vulnerabilities are received and completed and that include timelines for addressing vulnerabilities that account for the severity and exploitability of the risk implicated; and 11. Enforcing policies and procedures to ensure the timely investigation of data security events and the timely remediation of critical and high-risk security vulnerabilities.\n\nF. Assess, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results;\n\nG. Assess, prior to the acquisition of any entity that maintains, processes, or transmits Covered Information (“Acquired Entity”), the effectiveness of that entity’s safeguards to protect such information. Either during the acquisition due diligence process or following such acquisition, Respondent must independently test the effectiveness of the Acquired Entity’s safeguards to protect Covered Information. Respondent shall not integrate any application or information system into its network(s) until (1) all material risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Covered Information identified in such a test are remediated; and (2) such application or information system meets the requirements of this Provision. Provided, however, that Respondent shall have 90 days 7 after integrating any application or information system of an acquired entity into its networks to implement the requirements of sub-Provision V.E.6 with respect to such application or system.\n\nH. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) following a Covered Incident and modify the Information Security Program based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability testing of Respondent’s networks once every six months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident, and penetration testing of Respondent’s networks at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nI. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondent, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information; and\n\nJ. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program in light of any changes to Respondent’s operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision V.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondent knows or has reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards. At a minimum, Respondent must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program based on the results.",

Developing, implementing, and maintaining policies and procedures to minimize data collection, storage, and retention, including data deletion or retention policies and procedures. Such policies and procedures must include the secure disposal of Personal Information in any format no later than two years after the last date the information is used in connection with the provision of a product or service to the consumer to which it relates, unless such information is necessary for business operations or for other legitimate business purposes, including to comply with a properly authorized civil, criminal, or regulatory investigation, or subpoena or summons by Federal, state, or local authorities; to comply with the consumer’s request; where the information is otherwise required to be retained by law or regulation; or where targeted disposal is not reasonably feasible due to the manner in which the information is maintained. To the extent Respondents retain information for longer than two years after the last date the information is used in connection with the provision of a product or service to the consumer to which it relates, Respondents must document in writing the legitimate business purpose for which Respondents retain such information and must delete such information upon the conclusion of the stated business purpose. Respondents must periodically review Respondents’ data retention policy to minimize the unnecessary retention of data;\n\nF. Assess, at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results;\n\nG. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability testing of Respondents’ networks, systems, and assets once every four (4) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after a Covered Incident, and penetration testing of Respondents’ networks, systems, and assets at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nH. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Personal Information they access through or receive from Respondents, including by implementing policies and procedures to adequately vet and assess the service providers’ data security practices 11 prior to contracting with the service providers and periodically thereafter. Respondents must also contractually require service providers to (1) provide regular security training programs to their employees; and (2) implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information; and\n\nI. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program in light of any material changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in Provision I.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards.

The Assessor shall not withhold any such documents on the basis of a claim of confidentiality, proprietary or trade secrets, work product protection, attorney-client privilege, statutory exemption, or any similar claim, although such documents can be designated for confidential treatment in accordance with applicable law;\n\nB. For each Assessment, Respondents must provide the Associate Director for Enforcement for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission (\"Associate Director\") with the name, affiliation, and qualifications of the proposed Assessor, whom the Associate Director shall have the authority to approve in her or his sole discretion;\n\nC.

Each Assessment must, for the entire assessment period: 1. Determine whether each Respondent has implemented and maintained the Program required by Provision V of this Order, titled Mandated Privacy Program; 2. Assess the effectiveness of each Respondent's implementation and maintenance of Sub-Provisions V.A-J; 3.

Address the status of gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material non-compliance with, the Program that were identified in any prior Assessment required by this Order; and 5. Identify specific evidence (including, but not limited to, documents reviewed, sampling and technical testing performed, and interviews conducted) examined to make such determinations, assessments, and identifications, and explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an enterprise of the Respondent's size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify the Assessor's findings. No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions 12 or attestations by the Respondent's management. The Assessment must be signed by the Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by the Respondent's management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team worked on the Assessment. To the extent that any Respondent revises, updates, or adds one or more safeguards required under Provision V of this Order in the middle of an Assessment period, the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard; and\n\nE. Each Assessment must be completed within 60 days after the end of the reporting period to which the Assessment applies. Unless otherwise directed by a Commission representative in writing, Respondents must submit the initial Assessment to the Commission within 10 days after the Assessment has been completed via email to DEbrief@ftc.gov or by overnight courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580.

Clicking on the icon must clearly and prominently disclose: (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and currently running on the computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information.\n\nProvided that respondent may suspend the notice requirements of this Part and activate geophysical location tracking technology if a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or respondent otherwise has a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen, and b) either the renter or respondent has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen. Provided further that respondent shall retain documents establishing (a) and (b). For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the filing of the renter’s or respondent’s complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction.",

For purposes of this section, providing clear and prominent notice to computer users and obtaining affirmative express consent from computer renters means:\n\n1. Clear and Prominent Notice: a clear and prominent notice is provided to the user, separate and apart from any “privacy policy,” “data use policy,” “terms of service,” “end-user license agreement,” “lease agreement,” or other similar document, that discloses (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and/or currently running on the computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\n2. Affirmative Express Consent: affirmative express consent is obtained by giving the computer renter an equally clear and prominent choice to either agree or not agree to any geophysical location tracking technology, and neither option may be highlighted or preselected as a default setting. Activation of any geophysical location tracking technology must not proceed until the computer’s renter provides affirmative express consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Part shall require that a computer be rented to a user who declines to consent to installation or activation of any geophysical tracking technology;\n\n3. Icons: the activation of any geophysical location tracking technology shall be accompanied by the installation of a clear and prominent icon on the computer on which the technology is installed, such as on the desktop and in the desktop system tray of the computer. Clicking on the icon must clearly and prominently disclose: (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and currently running on the Page 4 of 8 computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information;\n\nProvided that the notice requirements of this Part may be suspended and geophysical location tracking technology activated if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen, and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen. Provided further that respondent shall ensure that documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained. For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the reporting of a complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction;\n\nProvided further that the notice and record-keeping requirements of this Section II shall be satisfied when respondent acts as a licensor if respondent includes in the licensing agreement contractual requirements that: (i) licensees may only activate geophysical location tracking technology if (a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or there is otherwise a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen and (b) either the renter or another person has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen, and (ii) documents establishing (a) and (b) are retained by the licensees; and\n\nB. Licensing, selling, or otherwise providing any third party with geophysical location tracking technology for installation or activation on a computer to be rented in a covered rent-to-own transaction, without requiring as a condition of the license, sale, or other provision of the technology that the third party obtain consent and provide notice as provided in Section II.A, above.",

      "verbatim_text": "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondents, and any business that Respondents control, directly or indirectly, in connection with the operation of, or provision of access to, any Hosting Service, must, within 90 days after the effective date of this order, establish and implement, and thereafter maintain, a comprehensive information security program (“Information Security Program”) that protects the security, confidentiality, and integrity of such Hosting Service and Covered Information. To satisfy this requirement, Respondents must, at a minimum:\n\nA. Document in writing the content, implementation, and maintenance of the Information Security Program;\n\nB. Provide the written program and any material evaluations thereof or material updates thereto to Respondents’ boards of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, or governing bodies or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of each Respondent responsible for that Respondent’s Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident;\n\nC. Designate a qualified employee to coordinate and be responsible for the Information Security Program;\n\nD. Assess and document, and update at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any Hosting Service or Covered Information that could result in (1) unauthorized access to any Hosting Service; (2) the unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (3) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information. Respondents must document such an assessment of Managed Hosting Services separately from any other service or environment;\n\nE. Design, implement, maintain, and document safeguards that control for the internal and external risks Respondents identify to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any Hosting Service or Covered Information identified in response to sub-Provision II.D of this section. Each safeguard must be based on the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in (1) unauthorized access to any Hosting Service; (2) the unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (3) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information. Respondents must also assume, in designing such safeguards: (1) a high likelihood of unauthorized access to the Hosting Service, due to the number of websites hosted on the Hosting Service; (2) a high risk of harm to customers of the Hosting Service and to users of websites operated by customers of the Hosting Service should unauthorized access to the Hosting Service occur; (3) customers operating websites in the Hosting Service are likely to maintain or collect sensitive information in or through the Hosting Service; and (4) a high risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information maintained on the Hosting Service or collected by customers of the Hosting Service, through websites they operate, should unauthorized access to the Hosting Service occur;\n\nF. Within 90 days of the issuance date of this order, implement, maintain, and document the following security measures: 1. Implement and maintain centralized system component inventories, including of hardware, software, and firmware elements, that track the out-of-date and vulnerable versions of each Respondent-managed software program, operating system file, and firmware that is installed on any tracked asset, and create an alert for each asset that is using an out-of-date or vulnerable version;\n\n2. Employ automated tools and mechanisms, such as a security incident and event manager (“SIEM”) or equivalent program, to support near real-time analysis of events;\n\na. Create and retain system audit logs and records collected by Respondents to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity; and\n\nb. Conduct and document, and update at least once every 12 months, an evaluation that considers, at a minimum, (i) industry standards regarding log collection and analysis to support event detections; (ii) event detections available in any SIEM in use by Respondents and the logs necessary to support such detections; and (iii) Covered Incidents from the previous 12 months in order to determine if additional detections are needed and, if so, which logs Respondents should collect and analyze to support such detections;\n\n4. Require that all logins by employees, contractors, and third-party affiliates of Respondents to any Respondent-managed secure shell (“SSH”) be authenticated using a method, such as certificates or public/private key pairs, in which at least one component of the credential transmitted to the relying party is not static across multiple authentications, unless such credential is short-lived. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the authentication method required by the preceding sentence, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub- Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\nG. Within 180 days of the issuance date of this order, implement, maintain, and document the following security measures: 1. Disconnect from the Hosting Service environment all hardware assets with Respondent-managed software installed that is no longer supported by a vendor, a Respondent, or other party through the provision of software updates or patches to address vulnerabilities, such as software that is considered end-of-life, or, if disconnection is infeasible, temporarily implement appropriate controls to mitigate threats and document a plan to disconnect the asset or software that includes an appropriate timeline;\n\n2. Use technical measures to detect and prevent anomalous changes to Respondent- managed critical operating system and application files by comparing such files to known baselines, such as file hash values, or, where such baselines are not available, by relying on methods such as non-signature-based technologies, including techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. In the alternative, Respondents may use immutable deployments to prevent unauthorized modifications of any system and application files managed by Respondents that are not monitored using such technical measures;\n\n3. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method for all employees of Respondents and staff of contractors and third-party affiliates in order to access and maintain access (such as through a single sign-on authentication method) to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database. Each such multi-factor authentication method shall not include telephone call or SMS- based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the multi-factor authentication options required by the preceding sentences, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub-Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\n4. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method, or widely-adopted industry authentication option that provides at least equivalent security, be provided as an option for customers to authenticate into any Respondent-developed Hosting Service administration tool or database, excluding any SSH or machine-to-machine-only interface, such as an application programming interface (“API”), that does not support multi-factor authentication, including offering customers at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security keys. Any information collected by Respondents from customers for the purpose of enabling multi-factor authentication may only be used for authentication purposes and no other purpose; and\n\n5. Protect any API developed by Respondents that provides access to any Hosting Service configuration or administration or Covered Information by, at a minimum: a. Using technical controls to require connections to the API to use HTTPS or an equivalently secure transfer protocol for all requests; b. Requiring that all requests to any such API that provides access to Covered Information, including any Hosting Service administration tool that can access Covered Information, be authenticated using a method that protects authenticity at the session level and includes appropriate protections against session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions; c. Using appropriate rate-limiting for connections to the API; and d. Monitoring inbound and outbound API communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks;\n\nH. Assess, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards and security measures in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and Covered Information, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results;\n\nI. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards and security measures at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability scanning of Respondents’ network(s) at least once daily, penetration testing of Respondents’ network(s) at least once every 12 months, and, in the event of a Covered Incident, a security assessment or penetration testing of affected systems promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following the Covered Incident;\n\nJ. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Hosting Services and Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondents, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and such Covered Information;\n\nK. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program as needed in light of any changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision II.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards or security measures. At a minimum, Respondents must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results; and\n\nL. Either during the due diligence process of the acquisition of any entity (“Acquired Entity”) that would become part of any Hosting Service or following such acquisition, Respondents must assess the Acquired Entity’s safeguards and independently test the effectiveness of the safeguards to protect from unauthorized access any Hosting Service of which the Acquired Entity would become a part. Respondents shall not integrate any of the Acquired Entity’s application or information systems into any Respondent’s network until (1) all material risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any Hosting Service identified in such a test are remediated; and (2) such application or information system meets the requirements of this Provision. Provided, however, that Respondents shall have 90 days after integrating any application or information system of an Acquired Entity into its networks to implement the requirements of sub-Provision II.G.4 with respect to such application or system.",

The Commission’s agreement to the suspension of part of the judgment is expressly premised upon the truthfulness, accuracy, and completeness of Defendants’ sworn financial statements and related documents (collectively, “financial representations”) submitted to the Commission, dated September 30, 2016, October 17, 2016, and October 19, 2016. D. The suspension of the judgment will be lifted as to Defendants if, upon motion by the Commission, the Court finds that Defendants failed to disclose any material asset, materially misstated the value of any asset, or made any other material misstatement or omission in the financial representations identified in Subsection IV.C. above.\n\nE. If the suspension of the judgment is lifted, the judgment becomes immediately due as to Defendants in the amount specified in Subsection IV.A. above (which the parties stipulate only for purposes of this Section represents the consumer injury alleged in the Complaint), less any payment previously made pursuant to this Section, plus interest computed from the date of entry of this Order.",

Known limitations of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System, including factors that are known to affect the accuracy of the Outputs of Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance Systems of the type deployed, such as image or sound quality, the method by which Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is collected, background images or sounds, the passage of time since the capture of a Biometric Information sample, or relevant demographic, physical, or other traits of 10 the individual to whom Biometric Information pertains (such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, or disability, alone or in combination); and e. The requirements of this Order; 3. Documenting, for each Output, any Respondent’s determination of whether the Output is Inaccurate and any actions that Operators take in whole or in part because of the Output; 4. Periodically, and at least annually, reviewing actions taken by any Operators in response to Outputs, updating the content of training for Operators to address systemic Operator errors identified by periodic reviews, and, if there is reason to believe that an Operator’s operation of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System increases risk to consumers, or if an Operator fails to comply with the requirements of this Order, terminating such Operator’s operation of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System; 5. Developing, implementing, and maintaining policies and procedures designed to ensure that Respondents have a reasonable basis for enrolling each consumer’s Biometric Information in any Gallery; 6. Implementing and maintaining policies and procedures to ensure that samples of Biometric Information used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System do not increase the likelihood of Inaccurate Outputs, including by: a. Developing, implementing, and enforcing written quality standards for Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System, taking into account the nature of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System, the manner in which the Biometric Information is captured, and characteristics of Biometric Information that could affect the accuracy of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System; b. To the extent that deployment of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System entails the creation of a Gallery, periodically, and at least monthly, reviewing such Gallery to identify and, as soon as practicable, remove samples of Biometric Information that (1) have been associated with two or more Inaccurate Outputs, including Outputs that were determined to be Inaccurate based on investigations conducted in response to consumer complaints pursuant to sub-Provision IV.C of this Order; (2) do not meet the quality standards referenced in sub-Provision III.D.6.a; (3) are required to be deleted pursuant to Provision V of this Order, entitled “Required Retention Limits for Biometric Information;” or 11 (4) have been enrolled without a reasonable basis or in violation of policies and procedures implemented pursuant to sub-Provision III.D.5; c. Periodically, and at least annually, reviewing the means by which Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is captured, including the extent to which any software or hardware used to collect Biometric Information is functioning properly and are consistently capturing samples of Biometric Information that meet the quality standards developed and implemented pursuant to sub-Provision III.D.6.a and are not otherwise contributing to the generation of Inaccurate Outputs; and 7. Conducting documented testing of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System prior to deployment and at least once every twelve (12) months thereafter. Such testing must be conducted with the Affirmative Express Consent of individuals whose Biometric Information will be used for testing and must: a. Be conducted under conditions that materially replicate the conditions under which the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is actually used, taking into account factors that affect the accuracy of the type of Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System to be tested, the means by which Biometric Information to be used in connection with the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System is captured, and the roles of Operators; b. Determine the rate at which the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System’s Outputs are Inaccurate, including by assessing the extent to which the Outputs can be verified using evidence or information other than an Output of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System. For example, if an Output indicates the identity of an individual, the Output is verified if it is corroborated by a review of government- issued identification documents; c. Identify factors that cause or contribute to Inaccurate Outputs; and d. Assess and measure any statistically significant variation in the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System’s rate of Inaccurate Outputs depending on demographic characteristics of the consumers whose Biometric Information is analyzed or used, such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, or disability (alone or in combination).\n\nE. Evaluate and adjust the Program in light of any circumstance that Respondents know or have reason to know may materially affect the Program’s effectiveness. At a minimum, every twelve (12) months, each Covered Business must evaluate the effectiveness of the Program in light of the System Assessment and the results of all monitoring, testing, and 12 documentation conducted pursuant to the Program. Respondents must implement modifications to substantially and timely remediate any identified risks that consumers may experience physical, financial, or reputational injury, stigma, or severe emotional distress, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect particular demographics of consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability (alone or in combination);\n\nF. Provide the written System Assessment and Program, and any evaluations thereof or updates thereto, to Respondents’ board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of Respondents responsible for the Program at least once every twelve (12) months; and\n\nG. Not deploy or discontinue deployment of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System if: 1. Respondents do not possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that is sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards generally accepted in the relevant scientific fields, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that Outputs of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System are likely to be accurate. For purposes of this Provision III, competent and reliable scientific evidence means tests, analyses, research, or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results; or 2. Respondents have reason to believe, taking into account the System Assessment, the Program, all consumer complaints, and all monitoring, testing, documentation, and evaluations conducted pursuant to the Program, that: a. Respondents’ use of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System creates or contributes to a risk that Inaccurate Outputs will cause consumers to experience substantial physical, financial, or reputational injury, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability, stigma, or severe emotional distress to consumers, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability; and b. The identified risks are not substantially and timely eliminated by modifications to the Program.",
