Developing and implementing configuration standards to harden system components against known threats and vulnerabilities. New system components shall not be granted access to Respondent’s network, resources, or Covered Information until they meet Respondent’s configuration standards; 8. Encryption of, at a minimum, all Social Security numbers, passport numbers, financial account information, tax information, dates of birth associated with a user’s account, Medical Information associated with a user’s account, and user account credentials on Respondent’s computer networks, including but not limited to cloud storage; 9. Policies and procedures to ensure that all information technology (“IT”) assets on Respondent’s network with access to Covered Information are securely installed and inventoried at least once every 12 months; 10. Implementing vulnerability and patch management measures, policies, and procedures that require confirmation that any directives to apply patches or remediate vulnerabilities are received and completed and that include timelines for addressing vulnerabilities that account for the severity and exploitability of the risk implicated; and 11.

Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability testing of Respondent’s networks once every six months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident, and penetration testing of Respondent’s networks at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nI. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondent, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information; and\n\nJ. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program in light of any changes to Respondent’s operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision V.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondent knows or has reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards. At a minimum, Respondent must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program based on the results.",

Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards in place at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) following a Covered Incident affecting 100 or more consumers, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results as necessary. Such testing and monitoring must include: (1) vulnerability testing of each Covered Business’ network and applications once every four (4) months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident; and (2) penetration testing of each Covered Business’ network(s) and applications at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nH. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program in light of any material changes to a Covered Business’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident affecting 100 or more consumers, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub-Provision D of this Provision, or any other circumstances that a Covered Business or its officers, agents, or employees know or have reason to know may have a material impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards. At a minimum, each Covered Business must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every twelve (12) months and modify the Information Security Program, if appropriate, based on the results;\n\nI.

Require each Vendor agree by contract (upon renewal or new engagement or, in any event, within 180 days of the effective date of this Order) to: 1. Develop and implement policies and procedures for the prompt remediation and investigation of any incident that results in the Vendor or Covered Business notifying, pursuant to an applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, any U.S. federal, state, or local government entity that information of or about an individual consumer was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or publicly exposed without authorization; and 2. Notify the Covered Business in writing as soon as possible, and in any event no later than seventy-two (72) hours, if the Vendor has reason to believe that any person has accessed, exfiltrated, or otherwise obtained without authorization Covered Information that the Vendor obtained from the Covered Business.\n\nK. Obtain or possess for each Vendor, within 180 days of the effective date of this Order, documentation regarding the Vendor’s information security program that is material to the security of Covered Information within the possession, custody, or control of the Covered Business, including, without limitation, documentation of the Vendor’s cybersecurity risk assessment conducted within the last twelve (12) months. The Covered Business must be in possession of such documentation before it provides the Vendor with access to Covered Information;\n\nL. Determine in writing, at least once every twenty-four (24) months, whether there has been a material change to the Vendor’s information security program. If there has been a 20 Case 2:23-cv-05023-KBH Document 19 Filed 02/26/24 Page 28 of 138 material change, the Covered Business must obtain or possess new documentation regarding the Vendor’s information security program that is material to the security of Covered Information within the possession, custody, or control of the Covered Business;\n\nM. Maintain in one or more central repositories all documentation about or provided by each Vendor pursuant to sub-Provisions J, K, and L of this Provision, including but not limited to each contract with a Vendor, for a period of five (5) years from when it was obtained or provided. This sub-Provision is in addition to and not in lieu of the Provision entitled Recordkeeping;\n\nN. At least once every twenty-four (24) months, and promptly following a Covered Incident affecting 100 or more consumers involving a Vendor or determination of a material change to a Vendor’s information security program under sub-Provision L of this Provision, conduct written reassessments of each Vendor (or, in the case of a Covered Incident affecting 100 or more consumers, each relevant Vendor) to determine the continued adequacy of their safeguards to control the internal and external risks to the security of Covered Information and document the basis for the Covered Business’s determination as to whether each Vendor’s safeguards are adequate. The level of the assessment for each Vendor should be commensurate with the risk it poses to the security of Covered Information; and\n\nO. Maintain in one or more central repositories all documentation created by the Covered Business pursuant to sub-Provision N of this Provision for a period of five (5) years from when it was created.

Determine whether Respondents have implemented and maintained the Information Security Program required by the Provision entitled Mandated Information Security Program for Covered Businesses; 2. Assess the effectiveness of Respondents’ implementation and maintenance of sub- Provisions A-O of the Provision entitled Mandated Information Security Program for Covered Businesses; 3. Identify any gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material noncompliance with, the Information Security Program; 4.

Identify specific evidence (including, but not limited to, documents reviewed, sampling and testing performed, and interviews conducted) examined to make such determinations, assessments, and identifications, and explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an enterprise of the business’s size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify the Assessor’s findings. No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management. The Assessment must be signed by the Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team worked on the Assessment. To the extent any Respondent revises, updates, or adds one or more safeguards required under the Provision entitled Mandated Information Security Program for Covered Businesses in the middle of an Assessment period, the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.\n\nE. Each Assessment must be completed within 60 days after the end of the reporting period to which the Assessment applies. Unless otherwise directed by a Commission representative in writing, Respondents must submit an unredacted copy of the initial Assessment and a proposed redacted copy suitable for public disclosure of the initial Assessment to the Commission within 10 days after the Assessment has been completed via email to DEbrief@ftc.gov or by overnight courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to: 22 Case 2:23-cv-05023-KBH Document 19 Filed 02/26/24 Page 30 of 138 Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580. The subject line must begin, “In re Rite Aid Corporation, FTC File No. C-4308.” Respondents must retain an unredacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment as well as a proposed redacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment suitable for public disclosure until the Order is terminated and must provide each such Assessment to the Associate Director for Enforcement within ten (10) days of request. The initial Assessment and any subsequent biennial Assessment provided to the Commission must be marked, in the upper right-hand corner of each page, with the words “Information Security Program Assessment” in red lettering.",

To satisfy this requirement, Respondents must, at a minimum:\n\nA. Document in writing the content, implementation, and maintenance of the Information Security Program;\n\nB. Provide the written program and any material evaluations thereof or material updates thereto to Respondents’ boards of directors, or a relevant committee thereof, or governing bodies or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of each Respondent responsible for that Respondent’s Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident;\n\nC. Designate a qualified employee to coordinate and be responsible for the Information Security Program;\n\nD. Assess and document, and update at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any Hosting Service or Covered Information that could result in (1) unauthorized access to any Hosting Service; (2) the unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (3) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information. Respondents must document such an assessment of Managed Hosting Services separately from any other service or environment;\n\nE. Design, implement, maintain, and document safeguards that control for the internal and external risks Respondents identify to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of any Hosting Service or Covered Information identified in response to sub-Provision II.D of this section. Each safeguard must be based on the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in (1) unauthorized access to any Hosting Service; (2) the unauthorized collection, maintenance, use, or disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (3) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of such information. Respondents must also assume, in designing such safeguards: (1) a high likelihood of unauthorized access to the Hosting Service, due to the number of websites hosted on the Hosting Service; (2) a high risk of harm to customers of the Hosting Service and to users of websites operated by customers of the Hosting Service should unauthorized access to the Hosting Service occur; (3) customers operating websites in the Hosting Service are likely to maintain or collect sensitive information in or through the Hosting Service; and (4) a high risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information maintained on the Hosting Service or collected by customers of the Hosting Service, through websites they operate, should unauthorized access to the Hosting Service occur;\n\nF. Within 90 days of the issuance date of this order, implement, maintain, and document the following security measures: 1. Implement and maintain centralized system component inventories, including of hardware, software, and firmware elements, that track the out-of-date and vulnerable versions of each Respondent-managed software program, operating system file, and firmware that is installed on any tracked asset, and create an alert for each asset that is using an out-of-date or vulnerable version;\n\n2. Employ automated tools and mechanisms, such as a security incident and event manager (“SIEM”) or equivalent program, to support near real-time analysis of events;\n\na. Create and retain system audit logs and records collected by Respondents to the extent needed to enable the monitoring, analysis, investigation, and reporting of unlawful or unauthorized system activity; and\n\nb. Conduct and document, and update at least once every 12 months, an evaluation that considers, at a minimum, (i) industry standards regarding log collection and analysis to support event detections; (ii) event detections available in any SIEM in use by Respondents and the logs necessary to support such detections; and (iii) Covered Incidents from the previous 12 months in order to determine if additional detections are needed and, if so, which logs Respondents should collect and analyze to support such detections;\n\n4. Require that all logins by employees, contractors, and third-party affiliates of Respondents to any Respondent-managed secure shell (“SSH”) be authenticated using a method, such as certificates or public/private key pairs, in which at least one component of the credential transmitted to the relying party is not static across multiple authentications, unless such credential is short-lived. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the authentication method required by the preceding sentence, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub- Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\nG. Within 180 days of the issuance date of this order, implement, maintain, and document the following security measures: 1. Disconnect from the Hosting Service environment all hardware assets with Respondent-managed software installed that is no longer supported by a vendor, a Respondent, or other party through the provision of software updates or patches to address vulnerabilities, such as software that is considered end-of-life, or, if disconnection is infeasible, temporarily implement appropriate controls to mitigate threats and document a plan to disconnect the asset or software that includes an appropriate timeline;\n\n2. Use technical measures to detect and prevent anomalous changes to Respondent- managed critical operating system and application files by comparing such files to known baselines, such as file hash values, or, where such baselines are not available, by relying on methods such as non-signature-based technologies, including techniques that use heuristics to detect, analyze, and describe the characteristics or behavior of malicious code and to provide controls against such code for which signatures do not yet exist or for which existing signatures may not be effective. In the alternative, Respondents may use immutable deployments to prevent unauthorized modifications of any system and application files managed by Respondents that are not monitored using such technical measures;\n\n3. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method for all employees of Respondents and staff of contractors and third-party affiliates in order to access and maintain access (such as through a single sign-on authentication method) to any Hosting Service supporting tool or asset, including connecting to any database. Each such multi-factor authentication method shall not include telephone call or SMS- based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the multi-factor authentication options required by the preceding sentences, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub-Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\n4. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method, or widely-adopted industry authentication option that provides at least equivalent security, be provided as an option for customers to authenticate into any Respondent-developed Hosting Service administration tool or database, excluding any SSH or machine-to-machine-only interface, such as an application programming interface (“API”), that does not support multi-factor authentication, including offering customers at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security keys. Any information collected by Respondents from customers for the purpose of enabling multi-factor authentication may only be used for authentication purposes and no other purpose; and\n\n5. Protect any API developed by Respondents that provides access to any Hosting Service configuration or administration or Covered Information by, at a minimum: a. Using technical controls to require connections to the API to use HTTPS or an equivalently secure transfer protocol for all requests; b. Requiring that all requests to any such API that provides access to Covered Information, including any Hosting Service administration tool that can access Covered Information, be authenticated using a method that protects authenticity at the session level and includes appropriate protections against session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions; c. Using appropriate rate-limiting for connections to the API; and d. Monitoring inbound and outbound API communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks;\n\nH. Assess, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards and security measures in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and Covered Information, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results;\n\nI. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards and security measures at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability scanning of Respondents’ network(s) at least once daily, penetration testing of Respondents’ network(s) at least once every 12 months, and, in the event of a Covered Incident, a security assessment or penetration testing of affected systems promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following the Covered Incident;\n\nJ. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Hosting Services and Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondents, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and such Covered Information;\n\nK. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program as needed in light of any changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision II.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards or security measures. At a minimum, Respondents must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results; and\n\nL. Either during the due diligence process of the acquisition of any entity (“Acquired Entity”) that would become part of any Hosting Service or following such acquisition, Respondents must assess the Acquired Entity’s safeguards and independently test the effectiveness of the safeguards to protect from unauthorized access any Hosting Service of which the Acquired Entity would become a part. Respondents shall not integrate any of the Acquired Entity’s application or information systems into any Respondent’s network until (1) all material risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any Hosting Service identified in such a test are remediated; and (2) such application or information system meets the requirements of this Provision. Provided, however, that Respondents shall have 90 days after integrating any application or information system of an Acquired Entity into its networks to implement the requirements of sub-Provision II.G.4 with respect to such application or system.",

For each Assessment, Respondents must provide the Associate Director for Enforcement for the Bureau of Consumer Protection at the Federal Trade Commission with the name, affiliation, and qualifications of the proposed Assessor, whom the Associate Director shall have the authority to approve in her or his sole discretion.\n\nC. The reporting period for the Assessments must cover: (1) the first 12 months after the issuance date of the Order for the initial Assessment; and (2) each 2-year period thereafter for 20 years after issuance of the Order for the biennial Assessments.\n\nD. Each Assessment must, for the entire assessment period: (1) determine whether Respondents have implemented and maintained the Information Security Program required by Provision II of this Order, titled Mandated Information Security Program; (2) assess the effectiveness of Respondents’ implementation and maintenance of sub- Provisions II.A-L; (3) identify any gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material noncompliance with, the Information Security Program; (4) address the status of gaps or weaknesses in, or instances of material non-compliance with, the Information Security Program that were identified in any prior Assessment required by this Order; and (5) identify specific evidence (including documents reviewed, sampling and testing performed, and interviews conducted) examined to make such determinations, assessments, and identifications, and explain why the evidence that the Assessor examined is (a) appropriate for assessing an enterprise of Respondent’s size, complexity, and risk profile; and (b) sufficient to justify the Assessor’s findings. No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management. The Assessment must be signed by the Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondents’ management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team worked on the Assessment. To the extent that Respondents revise, update, or add one or more safeguards required under Provision II of this Order during an Assessment period, the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.\n\nE. Each Assessment must be completed within 90 days after the end of the reporting period to which the Assessment applies. Unless otherwise directed by a Commission representative in writing, Respondents must submit the initial Assessment to the Commission within 10 days after the Assessment has been completed via email to DEbrief@ftc.gov or by overnight courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580. The subject line must begin, “In re GoDaddy Inc., C-####.” All subsequent biennial Assessments must be retained by Respondents until the order is terminated and provided to the Associate Director for Enforcement within 10 days of request. The initial Assessment and any subsequent biennial Assessment provided to the Commission must be marked, in the upper right- hand corner of each page, with the words “DPIP Assessment” in red lettering.",

No finding of any Assessment shall rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondent’s management. The Assessment must be signed by the Assessor, state that the Assessor conducted an independent review of the Information Security Program and did not rely primarily on assertions or attestations by Respondent’s management, and state the number of hours that each member of the assessment team worked on the Assessment. To the extent that Respondent revises, updates, or adds 8 one or more safeguards required under Provision IV of this Order during an Assessment period, the Assessment must assess the effectiveness of the revised, updated, or added safeguard(s) for the time period in which it was in effect, and provide a separate statement detailing the basis for each revised, updated, or additional safeguard.\n\nE. Each Assessment must be completed within sixty (60) days after the end of the reporting period to which the Assessment applies. Unless otherwise directed by a Commission representative in writing, Respondent must submit an unredacted copy of the initial Assessment and a proposed redacted copy suitable for public disclosure to the Commission within ten (10) days after the Assessment has been completed via email to DEbrief@ftc.gov or by overnight courier (not the U.S. Postal Service) to Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, 600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20580. The subject line must begin, “In re 1Health.io Inc., FTC File No. 1923170.” Respondent must retain an unredacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment as well as a proposed redacted copy of each subsequent biennial Assessment suitable for public disclosure until the order is terminated and must provide each such Assessment to the Associate Director for Enforcement within ten (10) days of request.

Marriott shall implement and maintain processes and procedures to schedule and install updates and security patches on that software in a timely manner, that require confirmation that any directives to apply patches or remediate vulnerabilities are received and completed, and that include timelines for addressing vulnerabilities that account for the severity and exploitability of the risk implicated; and\n\n10. Enforcing policies and procedures to ensure the timely investigation of Security Events and the timely remediation of critical and high-risk security vulnerabilities;\n\nF. Assess, at least annually and promptly (not to exceed 120) days following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results;\n\nG. Following the closing of an acquisition pursuant to which any Respondent assumes control of any entity that owns, licenses, maintains, processes, or transmits Personal Information (“Acquired Entity”), Respondents must assess whether the Acquired Entity’s information security program is in compliance with the mandated terms for the Information Security Program required by Provision II of this Order (“Post-Acquisition Assessment”). Respondents shall design, implement, and maintain a plan and timeline to address gaps and deficiencies identified in the Post-Acquisition Assessment. The plan shall address such gaps and deficiencies that relate to any Acquired Entity’s IT asset prior to Respondents’ use as a Marriott IT asset in the production environment;\n\nH. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards at least annually and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include a vulnerability management program reasonably designed to continually identify and assess vulnerabilities within Marriott IT assets containing Personal Information by (1) discovering vulnerabilities identified by reputable outside sources; (2) assigning risk rankings to new vulnerabilities; (3) running internal and external network vulnerability scans at least quarterly or after any significant change to such Marriott IT assets, and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) after a Covered Incident; and (4) performing re-scans to ensure that previously identified vulnerabilities have been properly remediated. Such testing and monitoring must also include a risk-based testing program reasonably designed to identify and assess security vulnerabilities within such Marriott IT Page 7 of 16 assets. This program shall include an appropriate schedule of risk-based tests including internal and external penetration testing, segmentation testing, and web application penetration testing to be performed on such Marriott IT assets that adequately takes into account security risk. Such testing shall not be less than annual, and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) after a Covered Incident, and shall include retests where necessary to confirm appropriate remediation;\n\nI. Select and retain vendors capable of safeguarding Personal Information they access through or receive from Respondents, and contractually require vendors to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Personal Information;\n\nJ. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program as appropriate in light of any changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in Provision II.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards. At a minimum, Respondents must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once annually and modify the Information Security Program based on the results; and\n\nK. Require the Marriott Franchised Hotels by contract to implement and maintain appropriate safeguards to protect Personal Information. Marriott also shall develop and implement a risk-based audit program to review compliance of Marriott Franchised Hotels with the obligations imposed by Marriott. Marriott shall retain appropriate contractual rights to enforce a Marriott Franchised Hotel’s compliance with such requirements.",
