Ifa representative ofthe Commission decides that direct redress to consumers is wholly or partially impracticable or money remains after redress is completed, the Commission may apply any remaining money for such other relief (including consumer information remedies) as it determines to be reasonably related to Respondent's practices alleged in the Complaint.

In the event such default continues for 10 days beyond the date that payment is due, the entire amount will immediately become due and payable.\n\nF. Each day ofnonpayment is a violation through continuing failure to obey or neglect to obey a final order ofthe Commission and thus will be deemed a separate offense and violation for which a civil penalty shall accrue.\n\nG.

Within 30 days of the entry of a final judgment, order, or settlement in a Related Consumer Action, the affected Defendant must notify the Bureau of the final judgment, order, or settlement in writing. That notification must indicate the amount of redress, if any, that such Defendant paid or is required to pay to consumers and describe the consumers or classes of consumers to whom that redress has been or will be paid. To preserve the deterrent effect of the civil money penalty in any Related Consumer Action, Defendants may not argue that any Defendant is entitled to, nor may any Defendant benefit by, any offset or reduction of any monetary remedies imposed in the Related Consumer Action because of the civil money penalty paid in this action or because of any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund. If the court in any Related Consumer Action offsets or otherwise reduces the amount of compensatory monetary remedies imposed against a Defendant based on the civil money penalty paid in this action or based on any payment that the Bureau makes from the Civil Penalty Fund, that Defendant must, within 30 days after entry of a final order granting such offset or reduction, notify the Bureau and pay the amount of the offset or reduction to the U.S. Treasury. Such a payment will not be considered an additional civil money penalty and will not change the amount of the civil money penalty imposed in this action.",

Each such multi-factor authentication method shall not include telephone call or SMS- based authentication methods and must be resistant to phishing attacks. In the alternative, Respondents may use widely-adopted industry authentication options that provide at least equivalent security as the multi-factor authentication options required by the preceding sentences, if the person responsible for the Information Security Program under sub-Provision II.C: (a) approves in writing the use of such equivalent authentication options; and (b) documents a written explanation of how the authentication options are widely adopted and at least equivalent to the security provided by multi-factor authentication;\n\n4. Require at least one multi-factor authentication method, or widely-adopted industry authentication option that provides at least equivalent security, be provided as an option for customers to authenticate into any Respondent-developed Hosting Service administration tool or database, excluding any SSH or machine-to-machine-only interface, such as an application programming interface (“API”), that does not support multi-factor authentication, including offering customers at least one method that does not require the customer to provide a telephone number, such as by integrating authentication applications or allowing the use of security keys. Any information collected by Respondents from customers for the purpose of enabling multi-factor authentication may only be used for authentication purposes and no other purpose; and\n\n5. Protect any API developed by Respondents that provides access to any Hosting Service configuration or administration or Covered Information by, at a minimum: a. Using technical controls to require connections to the API to use HTTPS or an equivalently secure transfer protocol for all requests; b. Requiring that all requests to any such API that provides access to Covered Information, including any Hosting Service administration tool that can access Covered Information, be authenticated using a method that protects authenticity at the session level and includes appropriate protections against session hijacking and the insertion of false information into sessions; c. Using appropriate rate-limiting for connections to the API; and d. Monitoring inbound and outbound API communications traffic, to detect attacks and indicators of potential attacks;\n\nH. Assess, at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards and security measures in place to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and Covered Information, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results;\n\nI. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards and security measures at least once every 12 months and promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following a Covered Incident, and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability scanning of Respondents’ network(s) at least once daily, penetration testing of Respondents’ network(s) at least once every 12 months, and, in the event of a Covered Incident, a security assessment or penetration testing of affected systems promptly (not to exceed 120 days) following the Covered Incident;\n\nJ. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Hosting Services and Covered Information they access through or receive from Respondents, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Hosting Services and such Covered Information;\n\nK. Evaluate and adjust the Information Security Program as needed in light of any changes to Respondents’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in sub- Provision II.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Respondents know or have reason to know may have an impact on the effectiveness of the Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards or security measures. At a minimum, Respondents must evaluate the Information Security Program at least once every 12 months and modify the Information Security Program as needed based on the results; and\n\nL. Either during the due diligence process of the acquisition of any entity (“Acquired Entity”) that would become part of any Hosting Service or following such acquisition, Respondents must assess the Acquired Entity’s safeguards and independently test the effectiveness of the safeguards to protect from unauthorized access any Hosting Service of which the Acquired Entity would become a part. Respondents shall not integrate any of the Acquired Entity’s application or information systems into any Respondent’s network until (1) all material risks to the security, confidentiality, and integrity of any Hosting Service identified in such a test are remediated; and (2) such application or information system meets the requirements of this Provision. Provided, however, that Respondents shall have 90 days after integrating any application or information system of an Acquired Entity into its networks to implement the requirements of sub-Provision II.G.4 with respect to such application or system.",

If a representative of the FTC decides that direct redress to consumers is wholly or partially impracticable or money remains after redress is completed, the FTC may apply any remaining money for such other equitable relief (including consumer information remedies) as it determines to be reasonably related to Defendants’ practices alleged in the Complaint. Any money not used for such equitable relief is to be deposited to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement.

Assess and document, at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) following discovery of a Covered Incident, internal and external risks to the privacy, security, availability, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information that could result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, alteration, use, Deletion, disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or (2) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of Covered Information;\n\nE. Design, implement, maintain, and document safeguards that control for the internal and external risks Defendants identify to the privacy, security, availability, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information identified in response to sub-Provision IX.D. Each safeguard 46 Docusign EnveClopaes IDe: 22A:32B5E-FcEv2--9050327-45D2C-FT-AS78 7 - 5 AD89o5cEuA0m55eDnEt 6 Filed 09/08/25 PageID.189 Page 47 of 71 must be based on the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, alteration, use, Deletion, disclosure of, or provision of access to, the Covered Information; or the (2) misuse, loss, theft, alteration, destruction, or other compromise of the Covered Information. Such safeguards must also include: 1. Policies, practices, procedures, and technical measures to systematically inventory Covered Information in Defendants’ control. Provided, however, that any Covered Information that Defendants are otherwise required to Delete pursuant to this sub-provision may be retained or disclosed to the extent requested by a government agency in a formal preservation letter that identifies the specific data to be preserved or required by compulsory process, a request from law enforcement, a litigation hold, or otherwise required by law, regulation, or court order; 2. Data access controls for all assets (including databases) containing Covered Information, including but not limited to: a. Limiting employee access to Covered Information by, at a minimum, limiting employee access to what is needed to perform that employee’s job function; b. Granting and auditing varying levels of access based on an employee’s need to know; and c. Requiring multi-factor authentication methods for all employees in order to access any assets (including databases) storing Covered Information.

Policies, practices, procedures, and technical measures to segment, or otherwise keep separate, Covered Information from Content; 4. Encryption, or at least equivalent protection, of all Covered Information in Defendants’ control that is reasonably linkable to a consumer, computer, or device, including in transit and at rest; 5. Technical, organizational, and as appropriate, physical controls to safeguard against unauthorized access to any asset (including databases) containing Covered Information in Defendants’ control, such as properly configured firewalls; 6. A data retention policy that, at a minimum, includes: a. A requirement that Defendants document, adhere to, and make publicly available on Defendants’ terms of service/use a retention schedule for Covered Information, setting forth: (1) the purposes for which the Covered Information is collected; (2) the specific business need for retaining each type of Covered Information; and (3) a specific timeframe for Deletion of each type of Covered Information (absent any intervening Deletion requests from individuals); 7. Policies, practices, procedures, and technical measures designed to ensure that Covered Information collected for verification or consent purposes, such as pursuant to Provision III of this Order, is not used for any other purpose or disclosed to a third party. Provided, however, the Covered Information collected 48 Docusign EnveClopaes IDe: 22A:32B5E-FcEv2--9050327-45D2C-FT-AS78 7 - 5 AD89o5cEuA0m55eDnEt 6 Filed 09/08/25 PageID.191 Page 49 of 71 for verification or consent purposes may be used for the purpose of complying with the requirements set forth in Provision III; to compensate Models; to provide customer support services to Models; to communicate with Models; to maintain the functionality and security of the Covered Services; to contact or cooperate with law enforcement regarding actual or suspected CSAM, NCM, or illegal Content; or to comply with any applicable law, regulation, or court order; and 8. Training of all of Defendants’ employees upon hire or within one hundred and twenty (120) days after entry of this Order, and at least once every twelve (12) months for employees with access to Covered Information, on how to safeguard Covered Information;\n\nF. Assess, at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) following discovery of a Covered Incident, the sufficiency of any safeguards in place to address the internal and external risks to the privacy, security, availability, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information, and modify the Privacy and Information Security Program based on the results;\n\nG. Test and monitor the effectiveness of the safeguards at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) following discovery of a Covered Incident, and modify the Privacy and Information Security Program based on the results. Such testing and monitoring must include vulnerability testing of Defendants’ network(s) once every four (4) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after discovery of a Covered Incident, and penetration testing of Defendants’ network(s) at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed thirty (30) days) after a Covered Incident;\n\nH. Select and retain service providers capable of safeguarding Covered Information they access through or receive from Defendants, and contractually require service providers to implement and maintain safeguards sufficient to address the internal and external risks to the privacy, security, availability, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information; and\n\nI. Evaluate and adjust the Privacy and Information Security Program in light of any changes to Defendants’ operations or business arrangements, a Covered Incident, new or more efficient technological or operational methods to control for the risks identified in Provision IX.D of this Order, or any other circumstances that Defendants know or have reason to know may have a material impact on the effectiveness of the Privacy and Information Security Program or any of its individual safeguards. At a minimum, Defendants must evaluate the Privacy and Information Security Program at least once every twelve (12) months and modify the Privacy and Information Security Program based on the results.",

To satisfy this requirement, each Covered Business must, at a minimum:\n\nA. Document in writing the content, implementation, and maintenance of the Information Security Program;\n\nB. Provide the written Information Security Program and any evaluations thereof or updates thereto to the Covered Business’ board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of the Covered Business responsible for the Covered Business’s Information Security Program at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) after a Covered Incident affecting 500 or more consumers;\n\nC. Designate a qualified employee or employees, who report(s) directly to the Executive Leadership Team (including the Chief Executive Officer, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Legal Officer) to coordinate and be responsible for the Information Security Program and keep the Executive Leadership Team and Board of Directors informed of the Information Security Program, including all actions and procedures implemented to comply with the requirements of this Order, and any actions and procedures to be implemented to ensure continued compliance with this Order;\n\nD. Assess and document, at least once every twelve (12) months and promptly (not to exceed 30 days) following a Covered Incident affecting 100 or more consumers, internal and external risks to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of Covered Information that could result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, alteration, destruction, use, disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (2) misuse, loss, theft, or other compromise of such information;\n\nE. Design, implement, maintain, and document safeguards that control for the internal and external risks Covered Businesses identify to the security, confidentiality, or integrity of 17 Case 2:23-cv-05023-KBH Document 19 Filed 02/26/24 Page 25 of 138 Covered Information identified in response to sub-Provision D of this Provision. Each safeguard must be based on the volume and sensitivity of the Covered Information that is at risk, and the likelihood that the risk could be realized and result in the (1) unauthorized collection, maintenance, alteration, destruction, use, disclosure of, or provision of access to, Covered Information; or the (2) misuse, loss, theft, or other compromise of such information. Such safeguards must also include: 1. Training of all employees, at least once every twelve (12) months, on how to safeguard Covered Information including, for information security personnel, security updates and training sufficient to address relevant security risks, and verifying that key information security personnel take steps to maintain current knowledge of changing information security threats and countermeasures; 2.

Develop and implement policies and procedures for the prompt remediation and investigation of any incident that results in the Vendor or Covered Business notifying, pursuant to an applicable statutory or regulatory requirement, any U.S. federal, state, or local government entity that information of or about an individual consumer was, or is reasonably believed to have been, accessed, acquired, or publicly exposed without authorization; and 2. Notify the Covered Business in writing as soon as possible, and in any event no later than seventy-two (72) hours, if the Vendor has reason to believe that any person has accessed, exfiltrated, or otherwise obtained without authorization Covered Information that the Vendor obtained from the Covered Business.\n\nK. Obtain or possess for each Vendor, within 180 days of the effective date of this Order, documentation regarding the Vendor’s information security program that is material to the security of Covered Information within the possession, custody, or control of the Covered Business, including, without limitation, documentation of the Vendor’s cybersecurity risk assessment conducted within the last twelve (12) months.

Assess and measure any statistically significant variation in the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System’s rate of Inaccurate Outputs depending on demographic characteristics of the consumers whose Biometric Information is analyzed or used, such as race, ethnicity, sex, gender, age, or disability (alone or in combination).\n\nE. Evaluate and adjust the Program in light of any circumstance that Respondents know or have reason to know may materially affect the Program’s effectiveness. At a minimum, every twelve (12) months, each Covered Business must evaluate the effectiveness of the Program in light of the System Assessment and the results of all monitoring, testing, and documentation conducted pursuant to the Program. Respondents must implement modifications to substantially and timely remediate any identified risks that consumers may experience physical, financial, or reputational injury, stigma, or severe emotional 12 Case 2:23-cv-05023-KBH Document 19 Filed 02/26/24 Page 20 of 138 distress, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect particular demographics of consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability (alone or in combination);\n\nF. Provide the written System Assessment and Program, and any evaluations thereof or updates thereto, to Respondents’ board of directors or governing body or, if no such board or equivalent governing body exists, to a senior officer of Respondents responsible for the Program at least once every twelve (12) months; and\n\nG. Not deploy or discontinue deployment of an Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System if: 1. Respondents do not possess competent and reliable scientific evidence that is sufficient in quality and quantity based on standards generally accepted in the relevant scientific fields, when considered in light of the entire body of relevant and reliable scientific evidence, to substantiate that Outputs of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System are likely to be accurate. For purposes of this Provision III, competent and reliable scientific evidence means tests, analyses, research, or studies that have been conducted and evaluated in an objective manner by qualified persons and are generally accepted in the profession to yield accurate and reliable results; or 2. Respondents have reason to believe, taking into account the System Assessment, the Program, all consumer complaints, and all monitoring, testing, documentation, and evaluations conducted pursuant to the Program, that: a. Respondents’ use of the Automated Biometric Security or Surveillance System creates or contributes to a risk that Inaccurate Outputs will cause consumers to experience substantial physical, financial, or reputational injury, discrimination based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability, stigma, or severe emotional distress to consumers, including in connection with communications of the Outputs to law enforcement or other third parties, taking into account the extent to which such harms are likely to disproportionately affect consumers based on race, ethnicity, gender, sex, age, or disability; and b. The identified risks are not substantially and timely eliminated by modifications to the Program.",

Provide documentation of its information security policies and practices related to protecting any Covered Information that may be obtained from the Covered Business; ii. Describe in writing how and where the Covered Information will be maintained and what safeguards are in place or will be implemented to protect it;\n\nb.

Maintain all documentation provided by each Vendor pursuant to sub-Provision II.E.1 for a period of five (5) years from when it was provided; and\n\n3. At least once every twelve (12) months, and promptly following a Covered Incident involving a Vendor, conduct written assessments of each Vendor to determine the continued adequacy of their safeguards to control the internal and external risks to the security of Covered Information.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section shall require respondent to rent a computer to a user who declines to consent to installation or activation of any geophysical tracking technology.\n\n3. Icons: respondent shall provide that the activation of any geophysical location tracking technology be accompanied by the installation of a clear and prominent icon on the computer on which the technology is installed, such as on the desktop and in the desktop system tray of the computer. Clicking on the icon must clearly and prominently disclose: (1) that geophysical location tracking technology is installed and currently running on the computer; (2) the types of user activity or conduct that is being captured by such technology; (3) the identities or specific categories of entities with whom any data or information that is collected will be shared or otherwise provided; (4) the purpose(s) for the collection, use, or sharing of such data or information; and (5) where and how the user can contact someone for additional information.\n\nProvided that respondent may suspend the notice requirements of this Part and activate geophysical location tracking technology if a) the renter reports that the computer has been stolen or respondent otherwise has a reasonable basis to believe that the computer has been stolen, and b) either the renter or respondent has filed a police report stating that the computer has been stolen. Provided further that respondent shall retain documents establishing (a) and (b). For purposes of this Order, “filing of a police report” means the filing of the renter’s or respondent’s complaint with the police department in any form recognized in the jurisdiction.",

Financial Statements of Balls of Kryptonite, LLC dated August 26 18 and August 27, 2009, May 13, 2010, and February 17, 2011, 27 including attachments; 28 2.

Financial Statements of Jaivin Karnani dated August 10, and 8 August 27, 2009, May 13, 2010, and February 17, 2011, 9 including attachments.. 10 Defendants stipulate that all of the materials submitted are truthful, 11 accurate, and complete. These documents contain material 12 information upon which the Commission relied in negotiating and 13 agreeing to the terms of this Order.\n\n14 B. If, upon motion by the Commission, a Court determines that 15 Defendants made a material misrepresentation or omitted material 16 information concerning their financial condition, then the Court shall 17 lift the suspension described in Section VI, and shall enter a money 18 judgment against Defendants, jointly and severally, for the sum of five 19 hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) as equitable monetary relief, 20 which amount shall become immediately due and payable by 21 Defendants, and interest computed at the rate prescribed under 28 22 U.S.C. § 1961, as amended, shall immediately begin to accrue on the 23 unpaid balance, provided, however, that in all other respects this Order 24 shall remain in full force and effect unless otherwise ordered by the 25 Court; and provided, further, that proceedings instituted under this 26 provision would be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other civil or 27 criminal remedies, as may be provided by law, including but not 28 limited to contempt proceedings, or any other proceedings that the 8 Case 2:09-cv-05276-DDP -E Document 57 Filed 05/20/11 Page 9 of 17 Page ID #:1253 1 Commission may initiate to enforce this Order.\n\n2 C. All funds paid to the Commission pursuant to this Order shall be 3 deposited into an account administered by the Commission or its 4 agents to be used for equitable relief, including, but not limited to, 5 consumer redress, and any attendant expenses for the administration 6 of such equitable relief. In the event that direct redress to consumers 7 is wholly or partially impracticable, or funds remain after the redress 8 is completed, the Commission may apply any remaining funds for 9 such other equitable relief (including consumer information remedies) 10 as it determines to be reasonably related to Defendants’ practices 11 alleged in the Complaint. Any funds not used for such equitable relief 12 shall be deposited in the United States Treasury as disgorgement. 13 Defendants shall have no right to challenge the Commission’s choice 14 of remedies under this Section. Defendants shall have no right to 15 contest the manner of distribution chosen by the Commission. No 16 portion of any payment ordered herein shall be deemed a payment of 17 any fine, penalty, or punitive assessment.\n\n18 D. Defendants relinquish all dominion, control and title to the funds paid, 19 to the fullest extent permitted by law. Defendants shall make no claim 20 to, or demand return of the funds, directly or indirectly, through 21 counsel or otherwise.\n\n22 E. Defendants agree that the facts as alleged in the Complaint filed in 23 this action shall be taken as true without further proof in any 24 bankruptcy case or subsequent civil litigation pursued by the 25 Commission to enforce its rights to any payment pursuant to this 26 Order, including, but not limited to, a nondischargeability complaint 27 in any bankruptcy case.\n\n28 F. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. § 7701, Defendants are hereby required, 9 Case 2:09-cv-05276-DDP -E Document 57 Filed 05/20/11 Page 10 of 17 Page ID #:1254 1 unless they have done so already, to furnish to the Commission their 2 taxpayer identifying number and/or social security number, which 3 shall be used for the purposes of collecting and reporting on any 4 delinquent amount arising out of Defendants’ relationship with the 5 government.",
