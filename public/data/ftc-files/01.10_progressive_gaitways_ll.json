    "factual_background": "Progressive Gaitways LLC, a Colorado medical equipment seller, falsely claimed on two of its websites (theratogs.com and gaitways.com) to be a current participant in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework. For the theratogs.com site, respondent had self-certified to the Safe Harbor in 2004 and 2005 but failed to renew after November 2006, yet continued displaying Safe Harbor participation claims through at least June 2009. For the gaitways.com site, respondent never submitted any self-certification to the Safe Harbor at all, yet made identical participation claims from at least June 2007 through June 2009. These false representations exposed respondent to FTC enforcement action under Section 5 of the FTC Act as deceptive practices affecting commerce.",
