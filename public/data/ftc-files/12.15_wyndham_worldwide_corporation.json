Between April 2008 and January 2010, hackers successfully breached Wyndham's computer network on three separate occasions, compromising over 619,000 payment card accounts and exporting data to a domain registered in Russia. These breaches resulted in more than $10.6 million in fraud losses to consumers and businesses.",
