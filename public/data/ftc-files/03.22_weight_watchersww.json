    "factual_background": "Defendants Kurbo, Inc. and WW International, Inc. operated a weight-management app and website—Kurbo by WW—specifically designed and marketed for children as young as 8 years old. Since at least 2014, Defendants collected personal information from children under 13 (including names, email addresses, phone numbers, height, weight, food intake, activity data, and persistent device identifiers) without providing adequate direct notice to parents and without obtaining verifiable parental consent, in violation of the COPPA Rule. The App's age-gate was non-neutral and effectively signaled to children that they could register on their own by claiming to be 13 or older, and hundreds of users who initially lied about their age subsequently corrected it to under 13 yet continued to have account access. When notices were eventually introduced, they were buried in hyperlinks, incomplete, and not accompanied by any meaningful parental consent mechanism until much later. Additionally, until August 2021, Defendants retained children's personal information indefinitely rather than only as long as reasonably necessary.",
