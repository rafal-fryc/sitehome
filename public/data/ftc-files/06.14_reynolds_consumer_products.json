However, the company failed to renew its certifications when they expired in April 2010 (customer data) and April 2011 (human resources data), causing its status to become 'not current.' Despite this, Reynolds continued to represent on its website from April 2010 until November 2013 that it complied with the Safe Harbor Framework, misleading consumers about its data protection practices.",
