In violation of these promises, GoodRx integrated tracking pixels and SDKs from Facebook, Google, and Criteo into its websites and mobile apps, transmitting users' prescription medication names, health conditions, and personal contact information to these advertising platforms without notice or consent. GoodRx went further by exploiting this shared health data to build targeted advertising campaigns on Facebook and Instagram, grouping users into Custom Audiences categorized by their specific medications or health conditions. GoodRx also displayed a false HIPAA compliance seal on the HeyDoctor homepage, misrepresenting itself as a HIPAA-covered entity, and failed to implement any formal internal privacy or data-sharing policies prior to February 2020. Even after its practices were publicly exposed, GoodRx failed to notify affected users of the unauthorized disclosures as required by the Health Breach Notification Rule.",
