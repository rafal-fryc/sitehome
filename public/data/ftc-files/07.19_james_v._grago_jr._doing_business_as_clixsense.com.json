Grago, Jr., collected personal information from approximately 6.6 million consumers who earned money by viewing advertisements and completing online tasks.

In February 2016, after downloading a potentially harmful browser extension without proper precautions, hackers breached the network and ultimately stole data on 6.6 million consumers, publicly posting information for 2.7 million users including hundreds of Social Security numbers.",
