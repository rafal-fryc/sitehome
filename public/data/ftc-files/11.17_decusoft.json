    "factual_background": "Decusoft, LLC, a New Jersey software company serving human resources applications, posted privacy policies on its website claiming it had certified its compliance with both the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework. In reality, although Decusoft initiated an application to the U.S. Department of Commerce for Privacy Shield certification, it never completed the necessary steps to participate in either framework. By falsely claiming certified participation, Decusoft misled consumers and businesses relying on Privacy Shield as a lawful mechanism for transferring personal data from the EU and Switzerland to the United States. The FTC charged this conduct as a deceptive act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.",
