(d/b/a Vitagene) sold DNA health test kits to consumers and made numerous prominent promises about privacy and security of sensitive genetic and health data. However, the company publicly exposed health reports and genetic data for over 2,600 consumers in unsecured Amazon S3 buckets, failed to implement basic security measures despite multiple warnings, failed to separate DNA results from identifying information as promised, could not delete consumer data upon request due to lack of data inventory, and retroactively changed its privacy policy to allow broader sharing of consumer data without consent.",

In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation requiring the disclosure (\"triggering representation\") is made through only one means. 2. A visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it appears, and other characteristics, must stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood. 3. An audible disclosure, including by telephone or streaming video, must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it. 4. In any communication using an interactive electronic medium, such as the Internet or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable. 5. The disclosure must use diction and syntax understandable to ordinary consumers and must appear in each language in which the triggering representation appears. 6. The disclosure must comply with these requirements in each medium through which it is received, including all electronic devices and face-to-face communications. 7. The disclosure must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication. 8. When the representation or sales practice targets a specific audience, such as children, the elderly, or the terminally ill, \"ordinary consumers\" includes reasonable members of that group.",
