Despite knowing users were under 13—evidenced by dates of birth collected during registration—the defendants allowed these children to create blogs, publicly disclosed their personal information in profile areas, and sold targeted banner advertising based on children's personal data including age, location, and sex. The defendants failed to post a legally compliant privacy notice, provide direct notice to parents, obtain verifiable parental consent before collecting children's information, or give parents any means to review or delete their children's data. These acts violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA Rule) and Section 5(a)(1) of the FTC Act.",
