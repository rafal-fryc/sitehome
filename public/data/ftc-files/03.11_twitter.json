Despite publicly representing that it employed administrative, physical, and electronic measures to protect user information and honor user privacy choices, Twitter failed to implement reasonable security practices for its administrative controls. From approximately July 2006 until July 2009, nearly all employees had broad administrative access using credentials entered on the same public login webpage used by ordinary users. These failures allowed intruders in January and April 2009 to exploit weak and improperly stored administrative passwords, gaining unauthorized access to nonpublic user data, resetting user passwords, and sending unauthorized tweets from high-profile accounts including those of Barack Obama and Fox News.",
