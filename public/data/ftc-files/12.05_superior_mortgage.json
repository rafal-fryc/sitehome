Despite being subject to the FTC's Safeguards Rule under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, Superior Mortgage failed to implement reasonable security policies and procedures from the Rule's effective date until at least May 2005. Specifically, the company failed to assess risks to customer information, institute adequate password policies, and encrypt sensitive data transmitted outside its network. Additionally, the company publicly claimed on its website that all submitted information was protected by SSL encryption, when in fact sensitive data was decrypted after reaching the web server and then emailed to company offices in clear, readable text.",
