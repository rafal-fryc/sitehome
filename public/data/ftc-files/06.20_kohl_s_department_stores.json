From February 2017 through March 2019, Kohl's implemented policies that restricted victims' access to records about fraudulent transactions, requiring victims to obtain such information only through law enforcement rather than providing it directly to victims as required by law. Kohl's continued these unlawful practices for over two years despite repeated complaints from victims and only changed its policy six months after receiving a Civil Investigative Demand from the FTC.",
