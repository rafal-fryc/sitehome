    "factual_background": "US Search, Inc. and US Search, LLC operated an online data broker website that sold search services providing personal information about individuals. From June 2009 to May 2010, the company charged consumers $10 for a 'PrivacyLock' service that promised to block their names and addresses from appearing in the company's search results. However, the PrivacyLock service failed to block information in many circumstances, including reverse searches by phone number or address, when consumers appeared as associates in others' searches, when consumers changed addresses, or when multiple records existed for the same person.",

        "representation": "The purchase or use of respondents' 'PrivacyLock' would prevent a consumer's name from appearing on respondents' website, in respondents' advertisements, and in respondents' search results",
        "fact": "In many instances respondents' 'PrivacyLock' does not prevent the names of consumers from appearing on respondents' website, in respondents' advertisements, and in respondents' search results. The 'PrivacyLock' does not block a consumer's information from appearing in the results of a 'reverse search' on the consumer's phone number or address, or in a search of the consumer's address in real estate records. Further, the 'PrivacyLock' does not block a consumer's name from showing up as an associate of someone else in a search for another person's name. When consumers change addresses, new records may be generated that are not be subject to the 'PrivacyLock.' When consumers have multiple records in existence (e.g., John T. Smith and John Thomas Smith), the 'PrivacyLock' may apply to only one record",
