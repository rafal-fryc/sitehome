Through these apps, HyperBeard allowed eleven third-party advertising networks to collect persistent identifiers from users in order to serve behavioral advertising. Until August 2019, when contacted by FTC staff, Defendants never informed these ad networks that the apps were child-directed, never instructed them to refrain from behavioral advertising, and never posted required privacy notices, provided direct notice to parents, or obtained verifiable parental consent before collecting personal information from children. These failures constituted multiple violations of the COPPA Rule.",
