The company obtained Privacy Shield certification in 2017, but that certification lapsed in 2018. Despite warnings from the Department of Commerce to remove its Privacy Shield claims, TDARX continued to represent itself as a current Privacy Shield participant. Additionally, while certified, the company failed to obtain the required annual attested verification statement confirming its Privacy Shield practices were true and implemented. When its certification lapsed, the company also failed to affirm to Commerce that it would continue to protect personal information received during its participation in the program.",
