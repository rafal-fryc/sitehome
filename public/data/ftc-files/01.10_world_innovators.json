In September 2004, the company failed to renew its certification, causing its status to be updated to 'not current' on the Department of Commerce's public website. Despite this lapsed status, World Innovators continued to display privacy policy statements on its website claiming it was a member of the Safe Harbor program and would uphold Safe Harbor Principles. The company maintained these false claims from September 2004 through at least the filing of the complaint in January 2010, nearly five years after its certification had lapsed.",
