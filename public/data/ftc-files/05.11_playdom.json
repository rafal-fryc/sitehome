(successor to Acclaim Games, Inc.) and its CEO Howard Marks operated approximately twenty online virtual worlds that collected personal information from children under age 13 without obtaining verifiable parental consent. Although Defendants' registration flow identified users under 13 and prompted entry of a parent's email address, children were immediately granted full access to the games and their personal profiles upon registration—before any parental consent was confirmed. Defendants' privacy policy falsely stated that children would be prohibited from disclosing personal information such as real names, addresses, and contact details, yet in practice Defendants allowed children to publicly post such information through profile pages and community forums. In approximately 1,224,000 instances, Defendants collected, used, and/or disclosed children's personal information in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule.",
