    "factual_background": "Petco Animal Supplies, Inc. operated an e-commerce website where consumers provided personal information including credit card numbers to make purchases. The company made public promises that customer data was encrypted and strictly protected against unauthorized access. However, Petco failed to implement basic security measures to prevent SQL injection attacks, storing credit card information in clear readable text in its database. In June 2003, an attacker successfully exploited this vulnerability and accessed credit card numbers stored in plain text.",

Petco only encrypted credit card information during transmission between browser and server; once it reached the server, it was decrypted and maintained in clear readable text. A visitor could use a commonly known SQL injection attack to obtain access to sensitive personal information in clear readable text, including consumer names, credit card numbers, and expiration dates",
