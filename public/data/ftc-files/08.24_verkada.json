    "factual_background": "Verkada Inc., a cloud-based building security company, sold security cameras to over 12,000 businesses—including schools and healthcare facilities—while failing to implement reasonable information security practices. These failures allowed a threat actor in March 2021 to gain Super Admin access to Verkada's network, view over 150,000 live customer cameras, and exfiltrate gigabytes of sensitive customer and consumer data. Despite these failures, Verkada falsely claimed to be HIPAA certified or compliant and Privacy Shield certified, and falsely represented that its products used industry-standard and best-in-class data security safeguards. Verkada also orchestrated undisclosed positive reviews by its own employees and a venture capital investor on Google Maps, and repeatedly violated the CAN-SPAM Act by sending millions of commercial emails without opt-out mechanisms, failing to honor opt-out requests, and omitting valid physical postal addresses.",
