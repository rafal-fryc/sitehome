Despite publishing privacy policies claiming to use 'state of the art technology' and robust security controls, respondents stored personal information in clear, readable text and failed to implement basic safeguards against well-known attack vectors. Between January and June 2007, hackers exploited these failures through SQL injection attacks, exporting the personal information of hundreds of customers — including credit card numbers, expiration dates, and security codes — to outside computers. Respondents did not discover the breach until December 2007.",
