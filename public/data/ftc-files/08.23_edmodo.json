    "factual_background": "Edmodo, LLC operated an online educational platform directed to children under 13, collecting personal information from approximately 600,000 students under 13 in 2020 alone without obtaining verifiable parental consent. Instead of fulfilling its own COPPA obligations, Edmodo improperly attempted to shift its compliance responsibilities onto schools and teachers by including buried, misleading language in its Terms of Service — without providing adequate notice, instructions, or links to help them comply. Edmodo also collected persistent identifiers from children to serve contextual advertising, a non-educational commercial purpose that schools and teachers had no authority to authorize on parents' behalf. Additionally, Edmodo retained children's personal information indefinitely (amassing ~36 million student accounts) until March 2020 when it finally adopted a two-year inactivity deletion policy — which it also failed to justify under the COPPA Rule. The FTC charged Edmodo with multiple COPPA Rule violations and unfair practices under Section 5 of the FTC Act for burdening schools and teachers with its legally mandated compliance duties.",

        "quoted_text": "16 If you are a school, district, or teacher, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible 17 for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all 18 parents or guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Services. . . . When obtaining 19 consent, you must provide parents and guardians with our Privacy Policy; you can find a sample 20 permission slip here [NO LINK PROVIDED]. You must keep all consents on file and provide 21 them to us if we request them. For more information on COPPA, please click here [NO LINK 22 PROVIDED].
