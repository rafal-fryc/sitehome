    "factual_background": "ExpatEdge Partners, LLC, a Minnesota company providing software and consulting services for expatriate programs, participated in the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework by self-certifying to the U.S. Department of Commerce in November 2002 and renewing annually through 2005. In November 2006, the company failed to renew its self-certification, causing Commerce to update its status to 'not current.' Despite losing its active Safe Harbor status, ExpatEdge continued to display statements on its website claiming it self-certified to the Safe Harbor Privacy Program from at least December 2002 through July 2009. The FTC alleged that these ongoing representations falsely implied current participation in the Safe Harbor framework in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.",
