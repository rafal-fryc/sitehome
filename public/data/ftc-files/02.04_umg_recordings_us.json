The company collected extensive personal information — including names, home addresses, telephone numbers, email addresses, birth dates, gender, and detailed interest/preference data — from tens of thousands of children without first providing adequate notice to parents or obtaining verifiable parental consent. Defendant used email-link click-throughs as its sole consent mechanism even for high-risk activities like bulletin boards, without verifying that the person clicking was actually the child's parent. Defendant also failed to provide parents any mechanism to review or delete their children's personal information, and its posted privacy policies did not clearly or completely disclose its data collection, use, and disclosure practices as required by the COPPA Rule.",
