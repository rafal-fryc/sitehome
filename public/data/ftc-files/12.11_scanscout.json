    "factual_background": "ScanScout, Inc. was a video advertising network that used Flash cookies (Flash local shared objects) to collect user data and deliver behaviorally targeted video advertisements from April 2007 until September 2009. Unlike standard HTTP cookies, Flash cookies were stored in a different location and were not controlled through browser privacy settings. ScanScout's privacy policy falsely told consumers they could opt out of cookie-based data collection by changing their browser settings. In reality, changing browser settings had no effect on ScanScout's Flash cookies, meaning users could not actually prevent ScanScout from tracking their online activities during this period.",
