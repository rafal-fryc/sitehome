From at least January 2012 through September 2017, RealPage used overly broad matching criteria with inadequate filters, resulting in tenant screening reports that included criminal records belonging to different individuals. Despite receiving disputes about inaccurate reporting, RealPage did not make changes to address these failures, potentially causing housing denials based on incorrect information.",

It used broad matching criteria (soft matches on first names, middle names, and dates of birth), employed inadequate filtering (only filtering by middle name, state, and gender when available), failed to assess accuracy of results even when reports contained internal inconsistencies or information about multiple individuals, and did not address these failures despite receiving disputes. This resulted in reports including criminal records of individuals with different names, dates of birth, genders, races, and photographs.",
