The company's privacy policy and EULA stated they would collect device data to provide software updates and product support in a form that does not personally identify users. In reality, the app transmitted users' precise geolocation and persistent device identifiers to third-party advertising networks without adequate disclosure. The app also began transmitting this data immediately upon launch, even before users accepted or refused the EULA terms, despite representing that users could refuse data collection.",
