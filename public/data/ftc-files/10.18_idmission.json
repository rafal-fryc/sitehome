    "factual_background": "IDmission LLC, a cloud-based technology platform provider, claimed on its website that it was a certified participant in the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, which governs the lawful transfer of personal data from the EU to the United States. Although Respondent initiated an application to the Department of Commerce for Privacy Shield certification in October 2017, it never completed the required steps to become a certified participant. Commerce warned IDmission to remove its Privacy Shield claims until certification was complete, but the company failed to do so. By continuing to display these claims at least through June 2018, IDmission deceived consumers and business clients about the legal basis for its handling of EU personal data.",
