    "factual_background": "InfoTrax Systems, a technology company providing backend operations systems for multi-level marketers, failed to implement reasonable data security practices to protect personal information of approximately 11.8 million consumers. As a result, intruders exploited vulnerabilities and accessed InfoTrax's servers undetected for nearly two years between May 2014 and March 2016, ultimately compromising personal information of over one million consumers, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, payment card data, and passwords. The breaches resulted in over 280 reports of fraud, including unauthorized credit card charges, new credit lines opened, and tax fraud.",
