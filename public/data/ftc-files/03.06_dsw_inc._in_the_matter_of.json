  "complaint": {
    "factual_background": "DSW Inc., a footwear retailer operating approximately 190 stores across 32 states, failed to implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information collected from credit card, debit card, and check purchases. The company stored sensitive data including magnetic stripe information in unencrypted files, failed to secure wireless access points, and did not adequately monitor for unauthorized access. In March 2005, hackers exploited these vulnerabilities and compromised approximately 1.4 million credit and debit cards plus 96,385 checking accounts and driver's license numbers, resulting in fraudulent charges and customer expenses.",

        "fact": "Respondent failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security by: (1) storing information in multiple files when it no longer had a business need; (2) not using readily available security measures to limit access through wireless access points; (3) storing information in unencrypted files accessible with a commonly known user ID and password; (4) not sufficiently limiting the ability of computers on one in-store network to connect to other networks; and (5) failing to employ sufficient measures to detect unauthorized access.",
        "conclusion": "Respondent's failure to employ reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect personal information caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. This practice was and is an unfair act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
