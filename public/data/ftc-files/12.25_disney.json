    "factual_background": "Disney Worldwide Services, Inc. and Disney Entertainment Operations LLC operate over 1,250 YouTube channels featuring child-directed video content, including clips from Frozen, Toy Story, Pixar films, and Mickey Mouse cartoons. YouTube's platform requires content creators to designate videos as 'Made for Kids' (MFK) or 'Not Made for Kids' (NMFK), a designation that controls whether targeted advertising and personal data collection are permitted. Disney adopted a corporate policy of setting audience designations only at the channel level, meaning child-directed videos uploaded to NMFK-designated channels were left as NMFK by default. This resulted in YouTube collecting personal information from children via persistent identifiers and serving targeted advertisements on child-directed videos without parental notice or consent. Despite YouTube notifying Disney in June 2020 that it had reclassified over 300 videos as MFK, Disney failed to revise its policy, and Disney itself also enabled targeted advertising campaigns on child-directed videos improperly marked as NMFK.",
