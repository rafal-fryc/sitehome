These services collected personal information from children under 13 — including names, birthdates, photos, and audio files — without providing adequate privacy notices, without obtaining verifiable parental consent, and without maintaining reasonable data security. In November 2015, a hacker exploited well-known vulnerabilities to access VTech's network, traversing from the test environment to the live environment and exfiltrating personal information stored in clear text for millions of parents and children. VTech's Privacy Policy falsely claimed that personally identifying information submitted through its Web Services would be transmitted using HTTPS encryption, when in fact no registration information was encrypted in transmission or storage for Learning Lodge or Planet VTech.",
