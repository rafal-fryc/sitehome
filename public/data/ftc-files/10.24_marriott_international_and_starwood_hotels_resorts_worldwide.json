(c) An audible disclosure, including by telephone or streaming video, must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it. (d) In any communication using an interactive electronic medium, such as the Internet or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable. (e) The disclosure must use diction and syntax understandable to ordinary consumers and must appear in each language in which the triggering representation appears. (f) The disclosure must comply with these requirements in each medium through which it is received, including all electronic devices and face-to-face communications. The disclosure must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication.
