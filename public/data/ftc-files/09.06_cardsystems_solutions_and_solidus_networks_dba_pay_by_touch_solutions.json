    "factual_background": "CardSystems Solutions, Inc. provided credit and debit card authorization processing services for approximately 119,000 merchants, handling over $15 billion in transactions annually. The company failed to implement reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect personal information stored on its computer network. In September 2004, a hacker exploited these security failures using an SQL injection attack, installing programs that collected and transmitted magnetic stripe data for tens of millions of credit and debit cards. This breach led to several million dollars in fraudulent purchases made with counterfeit cards, forcing issuing banks to cancel and re-issue thousands of cards.",

This practice was, and is, an unfair act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
