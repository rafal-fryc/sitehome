Although Respondent initiated an application for Privacy Shield certification, it never completed the necessary steps to actually participate in the framework. By publicly claiming it would remain 'compliant and current with Privacy Shield at all times,' the company deceived consumers and businesses about its data protection practices, in violation of Section 5(a) of the FTC Act.",
