The Clear and Conspicuous disclosure must be separate from any \"privacy policy,\" \"terms of service,\" \"terms of use,\" or other similar document. The following do not constitute Affirmative Express Consent: 1. Inferring consent from the hovering over, muting, pausing, or closing of a given piece of content by the consumer; or 2. Obtaining consent through a user interface that has the substantial effect of subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making, or choice.",
      "Clear(ly) and Conspicuous(ly)": "a required disclosure is difficult to miss (i.e., easily noticeable) and easily understandable by ordinary consumers, including in all of the following ways: 1. In any communication that is solely visual or solely audible, the disclosure must be made through the same means through which the communication is presented. In any communication made through both visual and audible means, such as a television advertisement, the disclosure must be presented simultaneously in both the visual and audible portions of the communication even if the representation requiring the disclosure (\"triggering representation\") is made through only one means. 2. A visual disclosure, by its size, contrast, location, the length of time it appears, and other characteristics, must stand out from any accompanying text or other visual elements so that it is easily noticed, read, and understood. 3. An audible disclosure, including by telephone or streaming video, must be delivered in a volume, speed, and cadence sufficient for ordinary consumers to easily hear and understand it. 4. In any communication using an interactive electronic medium, such as the Internet or software, the disclosure must be unavoidable. 5. The disclosure must use diction and syntax understandable to ordinary consumers and must appear in each language in which the triggering representation appears. 6. The disclosure must comply with these requirements in each medium through which it is received, including all electronic devices and face-to-face communications. 7. The disclosure must not be contradicted or mitigated by, or inconsistent with, anything else in the communication. 8. When the representation or sales practice targets a specific audience, such as children, the elderly, or the terminally ill, \"ordinary consumers\" includes reasonable members of that group.",

Deidentified information is not Covered Information.",

Has implemented technical safeguards to prohibit reidentification of the consumer to whom the information pertains; 2. Has implemented business processes that specifically prohibit reidentification of the information; 3.

Data that reveals only a mobile device or consumer's coarse location (e.g., zip code or census block location with a radius of at least 1,850 feet), or that is used solely for the purpose of generating such coarse location and then deleted within 48 hours of collection, is not Location Data.",
