    "factual_background": "Ascension Data & Analytics, LLC, an analytics company providing mortgage-related services, contracted with a third-party vendor (OpticsML) to conduct OCR scanning on mortgage documents containing sensitive personal information of approximately 60,593 consumers. Despite its own written policy requiring security vetting of service providers, Ascension did nothing to assess OpticsML's security measures before handing over the sensitive data. OpticsML misconfigured its cloud-based storage, leaving the personal information — including names, Social Security numbers, credit account numbers, and financial data — publicly accessible on the internet without a password for approximately one year (January 2018 to January 2019). During that period, approximately 52 unauthorized IP addresses accessed the exposed data, many from outside the United States including Russia and China. Ascension also failed to include adequate contractual safeguard requirements in its service provider agreements, in violation of the FTC's Gramm-Leach-Bliley Safeguards Rule.",
