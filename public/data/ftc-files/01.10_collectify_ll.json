The company self-certified to Safe Harbor in 2001, 2002, and 2003, but failed to renew its certification in October 2004. Despite losing its 'current' status, Collectify continued to represent on its website from October 2004 to July 2009 that it was complying with or seeking certification to the Safe Harbor Framework, when in fact it was not a current participant during that period.",
