    "factual_background": "EPN, Inc., a debt collection company, failed to implement reasonable data security measures to protect personal information of approximately 3,800 consumers. Due to inadequate security practices, the company's chief operating officer installed a peer-to-peer file sharing application on her computer connected to EPN's network, resulting in files containing names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, health insurance numbers, and diagnosis codes being exposed on a P2P network where they could be accessed by anyone.",

        "fact": "As a result of these failures, EPN's chief operating officer installed a P2P application that shared files containing personal information of approximately 3,800 consumers to a P2P network where they could be accessed by anyone. The breached files contained sensitive information including Social Security numbers and medical diagnosis codes that could be used for identity theft.",
        "conclusion": "Respondent's failure to employ reasonable and appropriate measures to prevent unauthorized access to personal information caused, or is likely to cause, substantial injury to consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. Therefore, Respondent's practices were, and are, an unfair act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
