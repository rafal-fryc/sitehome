Since at least July 2005, the company stored sensitive personal information in clear text, used weak wireless security, allowed weak passwords, lacked proper firewalls, and failed to detect intrusions. Between July 2005 and December 2006, intruders exploited these vulnerabilities to download and intercept tens of millions of payment card records and personal identification data from TJX's networks. The breach compromised tens of millions of unique payment cards and the personal information of approximately 455,000 consumers who made unreceipted returns, resulting in tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent charges claimed by issuing banks.",

Since at least July 2005, respondent engaged in a number of practices that, taken together, failed to provide reasonable and appropriate security for personal information on its networks. In particular, respondent: (a) created an unnecessary risk to personal information by storing it on, and transmitting it between and within, in-store and corporate networks in clear text; (b) did not use readily available security measures to limit wireless access to its networks, thereby allowing an intruder to connect wirelessly to in-store networks without authorization; (c) did not require network administrators and other users to use strong passwords or to use different passwords to access different programs, computers, and networks; (d) failed to use readily available security measures to limit access among computers and the internet, such as by using a firewall to isolate card authorization computers; and (e) failed to employ sufficient measures to detect and prevent unauthorized access to computer networks or to conduct security investigations, such as by patching or updating anti-virus software or following up on security warnings and intrusion alerts.",
