    "factual_background": "TJX Companies, an off-price retailer operating over 2,500 stores worldwide, failed to implement reasonable security measures to protect personal information on its computer networks. Between July 2005 and December 2006, intruders exploited these security failures to access and steal tens of millions of payment card numbers and personal information of approximately 455,000 consumers. The breaches resulted in tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent charges and required issuing banks to cancel and re-issue millions of payment cards.",

        "fact": "An intruder connected to respondent's networks without authorization between July 2005 and November 2005, installed hacker tools, found personal information stored in clear text, and downloaded it. Between May and December 2006, an intruder intercepted payment card authorization requests in transit and transmitted the files to remote computers. The breach compromised tens of millions of unique payment cards and personal information of approximately 455,000 consumers, causing tens of millions of dollars in fraudulent charges.",
        "conclusion": "Respondent's failure to employ reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect personal information caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. This practice was and is an unfair act or practice."
