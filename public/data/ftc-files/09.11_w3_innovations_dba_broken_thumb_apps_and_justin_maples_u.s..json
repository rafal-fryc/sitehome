Over 30,000 email addresses were collected from users of these apps, along with personal information from hundreds of registered blog commenters. Despite operating online services clearly directed to children, Defendants never posted a privacy notice, never provided direct notice to parents, and never obtained verifiable parental consent before collecting children's personal information, in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA Rule). The apps were listed in the 'Games Kids' section of Apple's App Store, featured content aimed at elementary school-age girls, and actively solicited user submissions via email and blog comment forms.",
