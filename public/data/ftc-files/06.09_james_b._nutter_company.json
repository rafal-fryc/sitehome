Nutter & Company, a Missouri-based mortgage lender, failed to implement reasonable and appropriate security safeguards for sensitive consumer personal information from at least September 2004 through November 2008. The company did not develop a comprehensive written information security program, stored personal information in unencrypted readable text, failed to monitor or control network access, and provided unencrypted backup tapes to a third-party vendor without contractual protections. As a result, an intruder was able to hijack the company's network to send millions of spam emails and could have accessed personal information without authorization. Additionally, the company violated the Privacy Rule by failing to provide accurate privacy notices, omitting security practices, misrepresenting disclosures to credit reporting agencies, and incorrectly limiting opt-out rights to 30 days.",
