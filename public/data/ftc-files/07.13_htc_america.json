The company introduced numerous security vulnerabilities that allowed third-party applications to access sensitive information (including text messages, location data, and audio recordings) and device functionality without user permission, undermining Android's permission-based security model. These vulnerabilities affected approximately 18.3 million devices and put consumers at risk of financial injury, physical tracking, fraud, and privacy violations.",
