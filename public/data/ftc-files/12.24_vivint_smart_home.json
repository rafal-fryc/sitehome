    "factual_background": "Vivint Smart Home, Inc. used a commission-based door-to-door sales force to sell home security systems, equipping representatives with software that required credit checks for financing approvals. Sales representatives discovered they could circumvent credit requirements by 'white paging'—pulling the credit reports of unrelated third parties with similar names—or by adding impermissible co-signers, allowing unqualified customers to obtain financing based on innocent third parties' credit histories. When these fraudulently-opened accounts defaulted, Vivint passed the innocent third parties' information to debt buyers, causing those individuals to be pursued by debt collectors for debts they never incurred. Despite knowing about these practices since at least 2016, Vivint failed to take meaningful corrective action, rehired implicated sales representatives, and did not establish a written Identity Theft Prevention Program until January 2020—months after the FTC began investigating.",
