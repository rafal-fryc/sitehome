        "fact": "Beginning in January 2003, Respondent rented to third parties for marketing purposes consumers' personal information collected through shopping cart pages, including the name, address, phone number, and purchase history of nearly one million consumers.

Respondent also did not adequately inform merchants that it intended to use customer information in a manner inconsistent with merchants' privacy policies.",

Further, because Respondent's practices were not adequately disclosed to merchants or consumers, the injury was not reasonably avoidable. These acts and practices constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
