    "factual_background": "Flo Health, Inc. operated a popular period and ovulation tracking app used by millions of women who entrusted it with intimate reproductive health data. Between 2016 and 2019, Flo Health repeatedly promised in its privacy policies that it would not share users' health information with third parties, yet it secretly disclosed that data to Facebook, Google, Fabric, AppsFlyer, and Flurry via embedded software development kits. The company did not contractually limit how these third parties could use the data, and several third parties were permitted—and in at least one case did—use the health information for advertising and product development. The practice was exposed by a Wall Street Journal investigation in February 2019, prompting Flo Health to immediately halt the sharing. Additionally, Flo Health had certified participation in the EU-U.S. and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks but violated multiple Privacy Shield Principles, including Notice, Choice, Accountability for Onward Transfers, and Data Integrity and Purpose Limitation.",
