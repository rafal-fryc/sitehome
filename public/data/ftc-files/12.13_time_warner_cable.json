    "factual_background": "Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) provided cable, internet, and telephone services to consumers and extended credit by allowing them to defer payment. TWC retrieved consumer credit reports and required some prospective customers with less favorable credit histories to pay a deposit or the first month's bill in advance, while a substantial proportion of customers with better credit were not required to pay such deposits. From January 1, 2011 through at least March 5, 2013, TWC failed to provide the required risk-based pricing notices to consumers who were charged deposits based on information in their credit reports, in violation of the Risk-Based Pricing Rule.",
