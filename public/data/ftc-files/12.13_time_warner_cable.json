    "factual_background": "Time Warner Cable (TWC) extended credit to consumers for cable television, high-speed internet, and telephone services. When reviewing service applications, TWC retrieved consumers' credit reports and required some prospective customers with less favorable credit histories to pay a deposit or first month's bill in advance. From January 1, 2011 through at least March 5, 2013, TWC failed to provide required risk-based pricing notices to consumers who were required to pay deposits based on their credit reports, in violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act's Risk-Based Pricing Rule.",
