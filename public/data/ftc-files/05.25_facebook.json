The brief responds to FTC Complaint Counsel's reply regarding whether the Commission has authority under Section 5(b) of the FTC Act to reopen and modify a 2020 consent order. Meta argues that Section 5(b) does not authorize modification of consent orders entered without a hearing, that the Commission lacks authority to enforce its own orders or adjudicate order noncompliance, and that the proceeding is unconstitutional under Article III.",
