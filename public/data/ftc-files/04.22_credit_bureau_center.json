Consumers believed they were obtaining credit reports to tour rental properties, but were instead enrolled in a $29.94 monthly credit monitoring service without their knowledge or consent. The scheme generated over 500 consumer complaints and millions of dollars in losses.",

As we've explained, section 19 is limited to 'such relief as the court finds necessary to redress injury to consumers.' § 57b(b). The judgment directs the Commission to deposit any excess money not used for consumer redress and administrative expenses 'to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement.' The Commission acknowledged at oral argument that this part of the judgment sweeps beyond the statute. We therefore modify part IX.D of the amended judgment to remove this sentence: 'Any money not used for such equitable relief is to be deposited to the U.S. Treasury as disgorgement.' As modified, the judgment is AFFIRMED.",
