Direct Lending used and resold these lists to third parties for general marketing purposes rather than for firm offers of credit, which is the only permissible purpose under FCRA. Equifax failed to maintain reasonable procedures to verify users' identities and permissible purposes, and continued selling lists despite knowing Direct Lending was violating policies. This resulted in millions of consumers' sensitive financial information being sold to entities without permissible purpose, including some that became subjects of law enforcement actions.",
