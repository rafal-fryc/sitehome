    "factual_background": "Reed Elsevier Inc. and Seisint, Inc. collected and sold consumer information including Social Security numbers through verification products. The companies failed to implement reasonable security measures to protect user credentials, allowing attackers to exploit weak password structures. Between January 2003 and mid-2005, attackers gained unauthorized access to sensitive information of over 316,000 consumers, leading to identity theft, fraudulent credit accounts, and activation of stolen credit cards.",

These practices resulted in multiple unauthorized access incidents affecting over 316,000 consumers, leading to identity theft and fraud.",

Respondents' practices caused, or are likely to cause, substantial injury to consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. This practice was, and is, an unfair act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
