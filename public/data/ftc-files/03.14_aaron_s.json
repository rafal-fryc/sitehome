    "factual_background": "Aaron's, Inc., a rent-to-own retailer, provided its franchisees with technical capacity to install PC Rental Agent software on rented computers. This software enabled franchisees to surreptitiously monitor consumers through keystroke logging, screenshots, and webcam activation without disclosure or consent. Aaron's facilitated this conduct by providing network access, technical support, and email infrastructure to receive and store over 100,000 Detective Mode messages containing highly invasive personal information including images of partially clothed individuals, children, medical records, and financial data. Despite knowing about these privacy violations since at least 2010, Aaron's did not revoke franchisee access until December 2011.",
