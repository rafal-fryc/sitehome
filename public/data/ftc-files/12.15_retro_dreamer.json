Through these apps, Defendants allowed third-party advertising networks to collect personal information in the form of persistent identifiers from child users in order to serve targeted advertising, without providing required notices or obtaining verifiable parental consent. Defendants were aware of COPPA and the July 2013 rule changes, having been notified by at least one ad network in November 2013 that certain apps appeared child-directed, yet they continued to allow other ad networks to collect children's personal information. This conduct violated the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule by failing to post adequate privacy notices, failing to provide direct notice to parents, and failing to obtain verifiable parental consent prior to collection of children's personal information.",

Defendants received notice that the Rule changed in July 14 2013 from a third-party ad network in November 2013, when the network asked 15 Defendants to identify its child-directed apps. In response, Defendants suggested 16 the ad network stop serving Defendants’ apps ads. In June 2014, the network 17 informed Defendants it believed that certain apps submitted to the network for ads 18 were directed to children under the age of 13, including Ice Cream Jump, Ice 19 Cream Drop, Cat Basket, Sneezies, Tappy Pop, and Wash the Dishes, and therefore 20 those apps would be excluded from the ad network.

Part 312) required Defendants to: (a) post a privacy policy disclosing their information collection practices (§ 312.4(d)); (b) provide direct notice to parents of those practices (§ 312.4(b)); and (c) obtain verifiable parental consent before any collection or use of personal information from children (§ 312.5(a)(1)). Defendants did none of these things.",

Part 312, and each collection, use, or disclosure of a child's personal information constitutes a separate violation for which civil penalties of up to $16,000 per violation are authorized under Section 5(m)(1)(A) of the FTC Act."
