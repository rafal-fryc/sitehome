The company allowed third-party advertising networks to collect personal information in the form of persistent identifiers from child users for targeted advertising purposes, without providing required notices to parents or obtaining verifiable parental consent as required by COPPA. Despite being notified by an ad network in 2013 about COPPA requirements and being informed in 2014 that certain apps were child-directed, Defendants continued allowing other ad networks to collect children's personal information without complying with COPPA.",
