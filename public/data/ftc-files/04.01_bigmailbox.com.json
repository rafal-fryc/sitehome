Despite knowing these websites were directed to children, defendants made no reasonable effort to identify child registrants or notify their parents. Defendants collected more personal information than necessary, used children's email addresses to send advertising and marketing materials, and automatically disclosed children's personal information to third parties. Their posted privacy policy falsely claimed they did not target children under 13 and that parental consent was required before registration.
