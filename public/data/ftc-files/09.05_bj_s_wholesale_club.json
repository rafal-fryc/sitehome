  "complaint": {
    "factual_background": "BJ's Wholesale Club operated approximately 150 warehouse stores that collected credit and debit card information from approximately 8 million members. From November 2003 to February 2004, the company failed to implement basic security measures to protect personal information, including encryption, access controls, and wireless network security. As a result, hackers accessed personal information stored on in-store computer networks, leading to several million dollars in fraudulent purchases made with counterfeit cards and forcing banks to cancel and re-issue thousands of credit and debit cards.",

        "representation": "Respondent collected and stored personal information including customer name, card number, and expiration date on its in-store computer networks",
        "fact": "Respondent did not employ reasonable and appropriate measures to secure this personal information. Specifically, Respondent: (1) did not encrypt the information while in transit or when stored; (2) stored the information in files that could be accessed anonymously using a commonly known default user id and password; (3) did not use readily available security measures to limit access to its computer networks through wireless access points; (4) failed to employ sufficient measures to detect unauthorized access or conduct security investigations; and (5) created unnecessary risks by storing information for up to 30 days when it no longer had a business need to keep it, in violation of bank rules",
        "conclusion": "Respondent's failure to employ reasonable and appropriate security measures to protect personal information and files caused or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers that is not offset by countervailing benefits to consumers or competition and is not reasonably avoidable by consumers. This practice was an unfair act or practice in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act."
